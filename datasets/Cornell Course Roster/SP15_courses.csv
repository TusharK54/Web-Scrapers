AAS 2100,South Asian Diaspora,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ANTHR 2410,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s.

Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments ""Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate"" or ""My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?"" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to ""become Americans""? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency?

This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography.

Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills"

AMST 4112,The Politics of Change,4,Graded,Spring,,,GOVT 4112,(HA-AS),,,"President Barack Obama was elected in 2008 amid hopes of his supporters that the United States would address numerous pressing domestic policy issues. In this course, we assess Obama's first term, examining why he accomplished his goals in some areas and not in others. We will also analyze the course that reforms took, and why alternative pathways were not pursued. Our inquiry will immerse us in the study of the institutional arrangements of American politics, the current political context, the challenges and opportunities posed by existing policies, and the legacy of past efforts to address key issues. In the first few weeks of the semester, students will learn about the relationship between the White House and Capitol Hill and the rise of partisan polarization in Congress. The body of the course will focus on prominent issue areas, such as: taxes and inequality, health care, higher education, K-12 education, and the environment. In each case, we will examine the issue in historical perspective by analyzing past reform efforts, and we will consider the Obama administration's record to date and consider the implications for success over the next few years. Students will have the opportunity to write in-depth research papers"

AMST 4306,Art and Social Histories,4,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,"ARTH 4761, VISST 4761",(CA-AS),,,"Topic for spring 2015: Mass Culture in the Great Depression.  This seminar explores public art and popular entertainments as the means for everyday people to politically engage or escape the Great Depression (1929-41).  Discussions include Living Newspapers, the Federal Theater Project, WPA printmakers, FSA photographers (Walker Evans, Dorothea Lange, Gordon Parks, Arthur Rothstein), and Social Realist painters (Reginald Marsh, Ben Shahn). Connecting these is FDR's New Deal, its controversial government support for the arts, and censorship.  We consider dance as political theater, big bands and swing, ""screwball"" comedies, Busby Berkeley ""gold diggers"" musicals, and Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers spectaculars.  We begin with the importance of early radio in the home and how it constructed gender and race through soap operas and serial thrillers, especially the Green Hornet and the Shadow.  Students will draw on the digitized American Memory Project, Ken Burns' documentary The Dustbowl, and the Johnson Art Museum print and photography collections.  Films include Gold Diggers of 1933, Stella Dallas, Sullivan's Travels, and Woody Allen's Radio Days"

The course will begin from the declaration made by Martin Luther King, Jr. that the struggle for a new world, inevitably political, is also beautiful, that is, that it is involved with aesthetics. ""The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery,"" raps Talib Kweli, thirty-seven years after King's speech.  What did King mean, and what have others in American culture meant, when they invoked beauty and struggle in the same breath?  What have the arts and radical politics had to do with each other?  When have radical politics and experimental aesthetics needed each other?  We will work with all forms of the arts; discussion will figure heavily in this effort; political and aesthetic theory will surface regularly"
AMST 4393,The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 4393, HIST 4393, HIST 6393",(HA-AS),(HB),,"In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the ""General Strike"" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion"

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

AMST 6308,Between Body and Mind: Anti-Universalism in Caribbean Postcolonial Thought,4,Opt NoAud,Spring,,,"ASRC 6308, LATA 6308, ROMS 6308",,,,"This seminar examines the relationships between consciousness and the body, as leading thinkers on Caribbean colonial and postcolonial conditions have posited them. Readings will be organized around three specific problems: (1) how secularism was employed in early, Modern Europe to determine the relationship between the native colonial subject's body, mind, and soul and enslavement; (2) how bodily consciousness and ""unconscious"" resistance (ranging from armed resistance to sports and dance) have been articulated as tools for struggling against various kinds of oppression; and (3) how anti-universalist claims emerged as political necessity for rectifying the relations between body and mind in the Caribbean's emancipatory discourses. We will read texts by Aristotle, Shakespeare, Hegel, Judith Butler, W.E.B. DuBois, C.L.R. James, McGary and Lawson, Elaine Scarry, Kamau Brathwaite, Césaire, Fanon, Sylvia Wynter, Glissant, Hortense Spillers, Paul Gilroy, and others"

We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses"
AMST 6472,The Problem with Rights,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 6472, FGSS 6472, GOVT 6776, HIST 6472, LGBT 6472",,,,"In June 2013, in the space of a week, the Supreme Court ruled on affirmative action, the legacy of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include ""classic"" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others"

ANTHR 2135,"Beyond Kings, Palaces and Temples: Introduction to the Archaeology of South Asia",3,Graded,Spring,,,"ARKEO 2135, ASIAN 2265",(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This course will explore major themes in the archaeology of the South Asian subcontinent from the earliest palaeolithic hunter gatherers to the development of large empires in the mid first millennium CE. South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology"
ANTHR 2400,Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas (e.g., Africa, Latin America, the West). Among the issues considered: ""political correctness"" and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity"
ANTHR 2410,South Asian Diaspora,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AAS 2100,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could ""culture"" serve as the basis for a shared identity?"
ANTHR 2455,Real World Anthropology,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course is designed to expose students to the range of ways and fields within which practitioners employ anthropological theory, methods and perspectives. Class format will include both lectures and workshop sessions with invited speakers. Both the invited speakers and the discussion topics will represent different broadly defined fields in which anthropologists practice. Through class discussion and writing, students will be expected to critically consider such issues as: research ethics, professional responsibility, the academic versus activist role, methodological practices, and the relationship between individual practitioners and the national, international, and organization contexts within which they work. Students will produce a major research paper examining a particular field of ""practical"" anthropology of their interest"

Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies"

In practice this can mean many different approaches, including some that are not traditionally termed ""historical archaeology"". This course explores the range of such efforts, asking questions like, What kinds of sites/contexts/data are amenable? What are the implications of the term ""historical archaeology"" itself? What has been and can be learned using these approaches?"
ANTHR 3400,Being and Becoming Black,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3402, ASRC 3400, LSP 3400",(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc"

It examines historical and current patterns of school achievement for minoritized youths. It also examines the cultural and social premises undergirding educational practices in diverse communities and schools. Policies, programs and pedagogy, including multicultural and bilingual education, are explored"
ANTHR 3420,"Myth, Ritual, and Symbol",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,RELST 3420,(CA-AS),(GB),,"Examines how systems of thought, symbolic forms, and ritual practice are formulated and expressed in primarily non-Western societies. Focuses on anthropological interpretations of space, time, cosmology, myth, classificatory systems (e.g., color, totems, food, dress, kinship), taboos, sacrifice, witchcraft, sorcery, and rites of passage (birth, initiation, marriage, death). Examines both the roles of specialists (e.g., spirit mediums, curers, priests, ascetics) and nonspecialists in producing these cultural forms"
ANTHR 3422,"Culture, Politics, and Environment in the Circumpolar North",4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIS 3422, AIS 6422, ANTHR 6422",(CA-AS),,,This course examines the cultures and histories of the circumpolar North.  The primary emphasis is on the North American Arctic and Subarctic with some attention to northern Eurasia for comparative purposes.  The focus is on the indigenous peoples of the region and the socio-political and ecological dimensions of their evolving relationships with southern industrial societies
ANTHR 3479,"Culture, Language, and Thought",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"The relationship among culture, language, and thought has been a core concern in anthropology. Language and culture are commonly defined as processes that are public and shared yet they also operate within and upon subliminal experiential realms. In this course we shall examine how anthropologists have explored this relationship, which is engendered in the interaction between culture and language as parallel mediating devices for the constitution, interpretation, and expression of human experience"

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

We will begin by looking at episodes in Colonial and recent history to illustrate some of the ways Maya thinking about history may differ from more familiar genres. We will then review basic aspects of precolumbian Maya writing, but we will focus mainly on analyzing texts from one or more Classic period Maya cities"
ANTHR 4230,History of Archaeological Thought,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ANTHR 7230, ARKEO 4230, ARKEO 7230",(HA-AS),(HB),,"This course examines the history of archaeological interpretation and representation. Through an immersion in various genres of thought and writing, we will chart the historical development of archaeology as it has been transformed from inception to today. The course is organized into two concurrent parts. The first provides an intensive overview of the dominant positions and problems in modern archaeological theory. In this section of the course, we will explore the major historical movements in archaeological interpretation since the formalization of the discipline in the 19th century through the contemporary constellation of thematic concerns. It is in these discussions that we will strive to bring forward the subtle logics that underlie archaeological analysis. The second section of the course centers on an exploration of archaeological representation and overlapping issues raised in the sister field of historiography. In this section of the course we will discuss general issues in the philosophy of history as they bear upon the production of landmark archaeological studies, engaging with a series of pivotal research projects. By the end of the course, students should have a thorough understanding of the theoretical frameworks that underlie contemporary archaeological research and the unique problems that follow efforts to interpret and represent the archaeological record"

Yet since World War II, his influence, his reputation, and his fascination for scholars in a wide range of cultural and political disciplines has steadily grown. He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today"
ANTHR 4419,Anthropology of Corporations,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ANTHR 7419,(SBA-AS),,,"This course develops an anthropological approach to corporations with a focus on large, profit-oriented, publicly-traded corporations. To denaturalize the corporation, we will consider competing cultural logics internal to corporations as well as the contingent historical processes and debates that shaped the corporate form over the past two centuries. The course will examine processes through which various social groups have sought to alter and restrain corporations as well as reciprocal corporate attempts to reshape the social environment in which they operate"

This seminar will problematize the simultaneous growth of neo-liberal, neo-socialist, and para-state formations. Using ethnography, documentary film, and theories of Latin American geopolitics, we will explore how dominant paradigms for political economy and fantasies of control emerge within contests over charisma, power, and legitimate violence. Why have indigenous and ethno-racialized social movements, or the return of the traditionally repressed, figured in projects of national or counter-national revitalization? What roles have self-defense organizations played in the re-definition of civil society? What does it mean to advocate for 'cultural diversity' or 'rights of nature'? Why have discourses of 'security' and 'human rights' come to be so charged in state bureaucracies and horizontalist political associations alike?

ANTHR 6010,Proseminar: Social Organization,6,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Focuses on linkages between culture and social institutions, representations, and practices. The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of ""practice"" follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones. Finally, Lacanian and Marxist visions of ideology as they relate to anthropological theory and ethnographic analysis are examined with particular emphasis on the cultural and social production of persons"
ANTHR 6130,Archaeology and Texts,4,Graded,Spring,,,ARKEO 6130,,,,"This seminar invites students to critically engage with the role of texts and material culture in reconstructing the past. Central to our discussion is a concern with the often contentious interplay between the disciplines of archaeology and the study of textual records. Is a complete understanding of ancient texts contingent upon the contextual information provided by archaeology and vice versa? What do we do in cases when text and material culture present contradictory perspectives? Should one perspective be privileged over the other? In addition to examining various case studies and analytic approaches that have brought together the archive and the field, we will explore how documents and artifacts are not straightforward 'sources' of information but were formed within specific historical and ideological contexts"

We approach the law from a critical anthropological perspective, as a signifying and significant sociocultural system rather than as an abstract collection of rules, norms, and procedures, to examine how legal processes and discourses contribute to processes of cultural production and reproduction that contribute to the creation and maintenance of differential power relations. Course material draws on anthropological, linguistic, and critical race theory as well as ethnographic and legal material to guide and document our analyses"

A central theme will be how notions of culture, power, and history are implicated in constructions of ""the Nation."" We will also explore the possibilities of an ethnographic approach to the nation and ask if such an analytical/methodological move may help us better grapple with the perplexing emotive dimension of nationalisms. The intersection of gender and nation will also form a section of this course"

The entire city confronts the student with almost 30 centuries of urban and architectural history. This course intends to reconstruct the urban history of Rome from its origins through the Middle Ages (10th century bc-12th century ad). The purpose of this course will be to discover the layers of Rome, combining archaeology with literature, architecture, and urban history with art history. The goal is a thorough and direct knowledge of the Roman and Medieval urban landscape and the way this landscape has sometimes survived until today. Special attention will be given to Roman and Medieval building typology, both private and public, and the development of the urban infrastructure (street system, water supply, fortifications, etc.). Strong emphasis will be placed upon continuity, use/reuse, and transformation of buildings and spaces, etc. Every week one or two different ""regions"" will be explored that are typical for a particular moment of the urban history. Visits to sites outside Rome also will be used to address the issue of urban history in Italy in antiquity and the Middle Ages"

Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual.

In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  "

ASIAN 1107,FWS: Remaking Japan,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"Hollywood remakes, once an occasional curiosity, have become a genre in and of itself. Not only do they allow for Anglophone filmgoers to experience those same stories transplanted into a form to which they can more readily relate, but they also spell profits and merchandising opportunities for production companies attempting at once to define and cater to a thriving niche market - to say nothing of Hollywood's recapitulations of its own classics, updated to reflect changing standards in technique, technology, and taste. Japanese films constitute a sizable yield of the Hollywood remaking machine, and as such deserve closer attention regarding the themes and trends to which they attend. Remaking Japan is designed to engender a deeper, more critical understanding of the issues involved in the art of remaking in the broader sense, and more specifically in the case of Japanese-American creative exchange, and uses that concept as the foundation for an intensive journey through interpretive, descriptive, and critical writing. Remaking Japan draws upon the medium of film to strengthen notions about the visual imagination of words, all the while engendering cross-cultural awareness of one of the world's largest market-driven industries"

South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology"

By challenging the dominant stereotype of the passive and victimized Chinese woman, this course aims to examine women's struggles, negotiations, and challenges of the normative discourse of femininity and domesticity in terms of various disciplines, including philosophy, anthropology, history, and literature. Through a combination of reading original texts with secondary scholarship, this course will discuss the issues of Confucianism and patriarchal family, the female body and sexuality, education and self-expression, women's economic status and religious life, gender and the state, the modernization of women, etc"

This course explores the unfolding of Buddhist life in contemporary South and Southeast Asia, in locations such as Burma, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Cambodia. We will see how the practices of meditation and philosophical reflection enter the lives of Buddhists, along with other expressions of devotion, aesthetic fascination, political action, and sociability. Our goal will be to recognize the sensual, emotional, and social qualities of Buddhist practice, and the ways in which life unfolds in a Buddhist idiom"

The course does not require specific knowledge of Islam, nor familiarity with Arabic, as students will be introduced to the fundamentals of Islam as a religious system as well as a historical phenomenon through the exploration of rituality. Besides geographic variations across the region, themes will include the combination of performances hailing from multiple religious traditions; the existence of shared patterns of rituality between different religious traditions; the impact of transnational networks and the conversation between local and foreign vocabularies of rituality"
ASIAN 3325,Tales of Crime and Justice from Pre-Modern China,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),(GHB),,This course examines different representations and notions of criminality and justice in a selection of Chinese historical and literary texts from early to late imperial times.

Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English. "

Along with major cultural and social transformations such as commercialization, the spread of literacy and printing, and increased social mobility, early modern China in particular witnessed the cult of love (qing). This unprecedented enchantment with love not only liberated inner emotions but also involved in the redefinition of self and the cultural and social order. Through a close reading of a variety of genres of texts, we will read major love stories as a discursive practice for constructing individual and collective identities and observing how these identities changed over time in relation to the shifting cultural, economic, social, and political situations"

Portrayals of 'the Other' by Japanese and of Japanese by 'the Other' take on a unique significance during this period because such representations are largely based on absence and imagination, not familiarity and fact. In this course, we will examine a variety of texts that document these encounters with the unfamiliar, including first- and secondhand non-fiction accounts, quasi-fictional illustrated novellas, theatrical portrayals of other countries, travelogues, images, and secondary literature"

This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

It brings Thai visual and print media materials into conversation with contemporary writing from feminist and queer theory, critical race studies, critiques of liberalism, Buddhist studies, visual studies, and affect theory.

Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history"

Following a brief historical outline of the development of the academic study of religion, we will survey major approaches to the academic study of religion currently used and discussed in Religious Studies today. We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did. The course operates as an intellectual history of the rise of the study of religion as an academic (as opposed to confessional) subject"

With a population of 12 million, congested streets, and soaring skyscrapers, Seoul has become an important socioeconomic, political, and cultural center, both within Northeast Asia and throughout the globe. However, underneath the glitter of modernity and globalization visible in the urban sprawl of contemporary Seoul are forgotten stories, stratified claims, and a tumultuous history which Japanese rule, a civil war, and US military presence.  We will examine Seoul's symbolic place in the world community as seen through the 1988 Olympics and how its minorities make this city their home. Special attention will be given to the entrance of technologies, the transformation of architectural spaces, and the emergence of new subjectivities.  By the end of the course, students will not only become familiar with Seoul's past, but also learn important concepts informing the burgeoning field of Korean studies"
ASIAN 4481,Translation and Cultural Difference,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 4700,(KCM-AS),(GB),,"Problems concerning translation are explored. Although there are many different models of translation, we tend to be confined to the unilateral regime of translation, that is, the very narrow and historically specific mode of translation as a transnational transfer of significance between two national or ethnic languages. This course will survey theories of translation with special emphasis on relationships between trans-national translation and transnational transference. Translation establishes a division of two spheres and thereby marks the limit of what can be expressed in one medium. Broadly understood, translation can take place not only between two national languages but also at a variety of boundaries within a single society. We will investigate different economies of translation by which different social and cultural identities are constructed, emphasizing the disappearance of multi-lingualism in the modern nation-state and the mutation of translation tropics which has given rise to new ways of imagining the organicist unity of the society. Historical transformation of translation accompanying the genesis of linguistic and cultural identity will be examined in reference to historical materials. Furthermore, the course will explore the broader conception of translation in terms of which to critically understand communication as the ideology of Capital"

ASRC 1822,FWS: African American Short Story,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"The short story is an ideal genre through which one might gain a basic introduction to African American literature and its major themes. As a form and genre, the short story's specific origins within African American literature are traceable back to the antebellum era of the nineteenth century. The genre was significantly advanced in the post-bellum era by authors such as Charles Chesnutt, thrived throughout the twentieth century, and continues to develop in contemporary African American literature. In this course, we will consider short stories by Chesnutt, Jessie Fauset, Nella Larsen, Arna Bontemps, Zora Neale Hurston, Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Ann Petry, Rosa Guy, Paule Marshall, Ernest J.

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies.

ASRC 2506,Africa from Partition to the Postcolonial State,4,Graded,Spring,,,GOVT 2503,(HA-AS),(GB),,"The title of this survey course refers to three specific moments in the history of Africa: the partition of Berlin (1884), the advent of neo-colonialism as independence (1960); and the post-structural adjustment 'failure' of the postcolonial state. It centers around The Congo, which stands as the symbol of this African crisis of modernity both as the geographic heart of Africa, one subject to imperial geopolitical games, and also the symbol of the 'darkness' that Africa has become to its foreign protectors, trustees, and mandatory powers, other interventionists - states and non-state entities alike"
ASRC 2542,The Making of Contemporary Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 2542,(HA-AS),(GB),,"Most people learn about Africa through the media.  However, media critics note that coverage is disproportionately skewed toward negative stories - poverty, war and corruption. While these factors are a reality for too many people on the continent, media observers note that too often the coverage lacks context and breadth.  Furthermore, media outlets do not report positive developments even where they exist.  This course will provide some of the depth and context necessary to understand events in contemporary Africa.  The first two-thirds of the course will examine African social and economic history since the nineteenth century - Africa's integration in the international economy, the rise of new social classes, the creation of the colonial state and the post-colonial state.  Our primary examples will be drawn from  East, West and Southern Africa to highlight both the similarities and differences of their historical development.  The final third of the course will examine several contemporary issues in which scholars and journalists have attempted to address the weaknesses in general press coverage"

This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries"

ASRC 3205,Thinking Black Intellectuals,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"""Thinking Black Intellectuals"" departs from the premise that there is always, in one form or another, a ""crisis"" - or, a question about the ""role"" of the intellectual. However, in the conception of this course, the intention is not to address this issue. Instead, the course seeks to ""demonstrate"" the act of, properly speaking, Black intellectual thinking. By reading a series of texts, from Black scholars in philosophy such as Valentin Mudimbe to the renowned African-American theologian and preacher, Gardner C. Taylor, from the artistic oeuvre of Fela Kuti to the interventionist work of Angela Davis, this course will engage the thought of Black intellectuals. What, the guiding question will be, does it mean to think, specifically, or not, as a Black intellectual?"
ASRC 3400,Being and Becoming Black,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3402, ANTHR 3400, LSP 3400",(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc"
ASRC 3590,The Black Radical Tradition in the U.S,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3590, HIST 3590",(HA-AS),,,"This course provides a critical historical interrogation of what Black Marxism author Cedric Robinson called ""the Black Radical Tradition."" It is designed to introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class and sexuality in social movements"
ASRC 3740,Contemporary African American Poetry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 3742, ENGL 3740",(LA-AS),,,"This course will examine a variety of voices in contemporary African American poetry, focusing on works produced in the decades following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Trethewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon"

ASRC 4110,James Baldwin and Philosophy,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ASRC 6110, ENGL 4510",(LA-AS),,,"As a writer, James Baldwin was active in many genres. Novelist, essayist, cultural commentator, and, of course, critic, are some of them. This course is interested in the ways in which James Baldwin might be said to have taken up philosophical issues in his writing. More simply phrased, what kind of thinking does Baldwin's writing evince? Baldwin, it seems, is never only taking up issues of race, or religion, or the diasporic condition, or critiquing America's failure to live to its own political promise(s). There is always a philosophical question at stake: Baldwin must be thought, at some level, through abstraction to get fully, properly, at the questions Baldwin is trying to address. To this end, this course will read Baldwin's works in relation to some of the criticism – the theoretical responses – that his work has provoked. Baldwin will be read as a religious thinker (the thinker of religion), Baldwin as a thinker of the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin as a film scholar"
ASRC 4291,Marriage and Divorce in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"FGSS 4291, HIST 4291",(HA-AS),(GB),,"Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage"
ASRC 4393,The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4393, HIST 4393, HIST 6393",(HA-AS),(HB),,"In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the ""General Strike"" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion"
ASRC 4402,Women in Hip Hop,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 4402, ANTHR 4102, FGSS 4402, LGBT 4402",(CA-AS),,,"This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

ASRC 4503,Picturing the U.S. Slave Narrative,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 4503,(LA-AS),,,"Before the advent of technologies like Facebook and Twitter, nineteenth-century viewers used new visual technologies-like collectible card-photographs and illustrated newspapers-to share information or publically debate social problems. In an effort to garner support for slavery's abolition, U.S. anti-slavery activists embraced ""illustrations,"" ""scenes,"" and ""pictures,"" as key rhetorical tools, using them to provide ""ocular proof"" of slavery's horrors and abolition's necessity. Via hands-on interaction with nineteenth-century images, and classroom study of slave narratives, illustrated newspapers, and photo-texts, we will pinpoint how visual images transformed not only the nineteenth-century slave narrative, but also its many literary after-lives. By reading nineteenth-century visual culture against more contemporary representations of slavery like Toni Morrison's 1988 novel Beloved, Kyle Baker's 2005 graphic novel, Nat Turner, and Steve McQueen's 2014 Academy-Award Winning film Twelve Years a Slave, we'll revise how we define a key genre in American literary studies"

Along with regular viewing of films and listening to music, several fiction and non-fiction texts will be studied. Close attention will be paid to how the 'cinematic gaze' represents a society which is still defining itself since the end of the colonial period"
ASRC 4602,Women and Gender Issues in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 6602,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"There are two contrasting views of the status and role of women in Africa. One view portrays African women as controlled by men in all social institutions. Another view projects women as having a relatively favorable position in indigenous societies they were active with an identity independent of men's and no concentration of women in a private sphere while men controlled the public sphere. This course examines critical gender theories and women in historical and contemporary periods. The topics covered include: non-westernized/pre-colonial societies; the impact and legacy of colonial policies; access to education and knowledge; women in politics and the economy in local and global contexts; women's organizations; armed conflicts and peace; same gender love and evolving family values; the law and health challenges; the United Nations and World Conferences on Women: Mexico 1975, Copenhagen 1980, Nairobi 1985, Beijing 1995 and post-Beijing meetings, and the 2010 superstructure of UN Women"

ASRC 6600,Education and Development in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,EDUC 5020,,,,"In the 1950s and 1960s, the human capital theory that emphasizes the importance of formal education for achievement of full productive potential of individuals and economic growth and development of countries enjoyed a renewed popularity. African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class.

Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests"

In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  "

To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called ""Christian Gnosticism."" Church Fathers condemned the ""movement"" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the ""gnostic"" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements"
CLASS 4637,Talmud and the Art of Reading,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"JWST 4776, NES 4776, RELST 4776",(LA-AS),(GB),,"The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism. Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written. Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.

Of importance to the course is the practical and conceptual relation of 20th-century visual technologies (photography, cinema, video, and computing) to their historical corollaries in the arts. The course draws on the visual traditions of both Western and non-Western societies and study texts that have defined the premises and analytic vocabularies of the visual.

The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it?

Analyzing poetic exchanges between Langston Hughes and Nicolás Guillén, theories of guerrilla warfare and ""Rebel Radio,"" novels made from tape recordings, and multi-media films, we will discover how Cuban culture helped define artistic movements across the world. Since many of Cuba's most recognizable figures, such as José Martí, spent much of their life outside the island, or, like Ernesto ""Che"" Guevara, were born elsewhere, we will pay special attention to how technology helps us understand Cuban culture through a transnational or hemispheric framework.

In this course we will trace the perplexing stories of these dreams as they pass from Milton to the Romantic poets, whose poetry can be said to rewrite the peculiar relation between falling and dreaming in a new language of mortality and survival.

Our methodology, while non-reductionist, will take into account the current state of cognitive science, and also build on literary theory and philosophy (both ""analytic"" and ""Continental""). Poetry makes use of cognitive structures and paths, of formal repetitions and algorithms-but it also alters and challenges the usual boundaries of thought. Thus, we need to consider both the ordinary and the extraordinary, if we ever want to explain the mental performance of the poetic. A comparative corpus of poems (written in European languages, from Antiquity to the 20th century) will be used throughout the semester.

Although there are many different models of translation, we tend to be confined to the unilateral regime of translation, that is, the very narrow and historically specific mode of translation as a transnational transfer of significance between two national or ethnic languages. This course will survey theories of translation with special emphasis on relationships between trans-national translation and transnational transference. Translation establishes a division of two spheres and thereby marks the limit of what can be expressed in one medium. Broadly understood, translation can take place not only between two national languages but also at a variety of boundaries within a single society. We will investigate different economies of translation by which different social and cultural identities are constructed, emphasizing the disappearance of multi-lingualism in the modern nation-state and the mutation of translation tropics which has given rise to new ways of imagining the organicist unity of the society. Historical transformation of translation accompanying the genesis of linguistic and cultural identity will be examined in reference to historical materials. Furthermore, the course will explore the broader conception of translation in terms of which to critically understand communication as the ideology of Capital"

This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities"

Bioarchives such as genetic codes lend themselves to grammatechnical methodologies-i.e. reading according to the materiality of inscription and the letter-because these codes are free from principles of teleology, intentionality, and consciousness: in short, the ""natural"" signs that constitute genetic codes should be read as purely material positings.

We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland.

Our methodology, while non-reductionist, will take into account the current state of cognitive science, and also build on literary theory and philosophy (both ""analytic"" and ""Continental""). Poetry makes use of cognitive structures and paths, of formal repetitions and algorithms-but it also alters and challenges the usual boundaries of thought. Thus, we need to consider both the ordinary and the extraordinary, if we ever want to explain the mental performance of the poetic. A comparative corpus of poems (written in European languages, from Antiquity to the 20th century) will be used throughout the semester. Students from very diverse backgrounds but with an interest in mind and/or language and poetry are welcome"

He is seen as a bridging figure between German and Jewish studies, between materialist critique of culture and the submerged yet powerful voice of theology, between literary history and philosophy. We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today"

While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law. Readings will include ""classic"" critics of liberalism such as Marx, Nietzsche, Althusser, and Foucault, and contemporary authors such as Wendy Brown, Elizabeth Povinelli, Lisa Duggan, David Eng, Janet Halley, Katherine Franke, and Jasbir Puar, among others"

This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Disgraced officials are sent to far-flung provinces, loyalists to past regimes hide out across China's borders, and dissidents have their entry visas revoked, making it impossible for them to return home. The experiences of these people, and the poems and stories they write, tell us a great deal about what it means and how it feels to be included and excluded. What is the difference between the way China looks from the inside and the way it looks from the outside? Who has the power to decide who gets to live in China, and how and why do they use it? What is the relationship between our identities and our homes? Texts studied will range from 300 BCE to the present; all will be read and discussed in English"

Nor do they embody the antipodes of East and West, framing Europe and North America as the symbolic centers. Rather, accelerated by recent geopolitical and global economic shifts, new connections between Asia and Latin America revive the ""swarmlike buzz of activity"" around and across the perimeter of the Pacific that Claude Lévi-Strauss had pitted against ""the great Atlantic silence"" prior to the European ""discovery"" of the Americas. This course explores different perspectives on the intercultural study of Asia and Latin America with the aim of rethinking the Transpacific as a method and a lens for comparison that challenges conventional geopolitical models, rather than simply an area or a region. To do so, we will explore multiple meanings, methodologies, and mappings of the Transpacific through a wide range of real and imagined links between Asian and Latin American literature, art, and theory: from diaspora, textual circulation, and cultural exchanges to uneven dialogues, compelling analogies, and conceptual affinities"

Conceived as a uniquely European phenomenon that spread to the rest of the world through the impact of colonial empires and the world market, it also supplies the normative frameworks for many contemporary theories of development. This conception of modernity, and the meta-theories that legitimate it, has been the subject of increasingly heated scholarly controversy.

Course members will read in relevant published material and write and revise their own work regularly, while reviewing and responding to one another's. Since these seminar-sized courses depend on members' full participation, regular attendance and submission of written work are required. Students and instructors will confer individually throughout the term"
ENGL 2999,The First American University,1,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2001, HIST 2005",,,,"Educational historian Frederick Rudolph called Cornell University ""the first American university,"" referring to its unique role as a coeducational, nonsectarian, land-grant institution with a broad curriculum and diverse student body. In this course, we will explore the history of Cornell, taking as our focus the pledge of Ezra Cornell and Andrew Dickson White to found a university where ""any person can find instruction in any study."" The course will cover a wide range of topics and perspectives relating to the faculty, student body, evolution of campus, and important events and eras in Cornell history. Stories and vignettes will provide background on the current university and its administrative structure, campus traditions, and the names that adorn buildings and memorials throughout campus. Finally, the course will offer a forum for students to address questions on present-day aspects of the university"
ENGL 3050,History of the Book,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MEDVL 3050,(HA-AS),(HB),,"This course provides an overview of the book as a material and cultural artifact. Focusing on the era of the printed book (1450-2000) in Western Europe and America, we will examine the invention and spread of printing and publishing, and the evolution of book design, illustration, and binding. The course will place an emphasis on practical tools for the identification and analysis of books and other printed artifacts, especially for literary students. Investigations and assignments will be built around hands-on interaction with examples of Cornell Library's rare books and manuscripts"

It will analyze four phases of video and new media: (1) the development of video from its earliest turn away from television; (2) video's relation to art and installation; (3) video's migration into digital art; (4) the relation of video and new media to visual theory and social movements.

Attention will be given to relevant literary, cultural, and linguistic issues. One semester's study of Old English, or the equivalent, is recommended"
ENGL 3140,Love and Ecstasy: Forms of Devotion in Medieval English Literature,4,Graded,Spring,,,MEDVL 3140,(LA-AS),(HB),,"What do love, torture, and ecstasy all have in common? How could they all be considered spiritual experiences? The thirteenth century brought a new and intense focus on the body of Christ, bloodied, wounded, and tortured. Female and male mystics began to describe Jesus as a lord, lover, and even mother in most intimate—and even sexual—terms. Guides for meditation, memory work, and holy living focused on bodily practices for approaching the divine and replicating the suffering of Christ. In this course we will explore a range of literary texts and artistic representations that illuminate this religious and aesthetic ethos. Readings will be in modern and medieval English, and will also include contemporary theoretical texts"
ENGL 3190,Chaucer,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MEDVL 3190,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Chaucer became known as the ""father of English poetry"" before he was entirely cold in his grave. Why is what he wrote more than six hundred years ago still riveting for us today? It's not just because he is the granddaddy of this language and its literature; it's because what he wrote was funny, fierce, thoughtful, political, philosophical and, oh yes, notoriously bawdy. We'll read some of Chaucer's brilliant early work, and then dig into his two greatest achievements: the epic Troilus and Crisyede, and The Canterbury Tales, his oft-censored panorama of medieval English life. Chaucer will be read in Middle English, which will prove surprisingly easy and pleasant"
ENGL 3230,Renaissance Poetry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"From the sixteenth century to the present, love and its codes have intrigued writers and readers. What does it mean when love is the theme? Hearts, flowers, cupids? Seduction, ambition, power? How are private feelings and historical forces linked? Can writing poetry endanger your career or even your life? This course is for anyone interested in poetry, regardless of background, willing to work in a small discussion setting to examine the craft of lyric, ponder a range of questions, and think about the stakes of reading Renaissance poetry. Some of the authors and poems will be familiar to you (Shakespeare, Donne), others will be new. Our goal is to open windows for reading them. Expect the unexpected and some serious fun with rich material"
ENGL 3270,Shakespeare: The Late Plays,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PMA 3770,(LA-AS),(HB),,"The course focuses on Shakespeare's middle to late plays, from the ""problem comedies,"" through the great tragedies, and romances. While we will pay particular attention to questions of dramatic form and historical context, the primary concentration will be on careful close readings of the play-texts themselves in relation to issues of power, politics, and performance. One of the commonplaces in Shakespeare criticism is a division between Shakespeare on the page and on the stage. Throughout the semester, we will consider what this difference could mean. On the way, we will encounter problems linked to art, sexuality, violence, identity, emotion, the body, family, God, the nation, nature and money (not necessarily in that order) - to name a few"
ENGL 3330,Fictions of Self-Invention: The Eighteenth Century Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"If the Satanic fantasy is to believe ourselves ""Self-begot, self-raised by our own quickning power"" as Milton says, then the early novel is diabolical. Foundlings and orphans, abandoned wives, abducted daughters, incestuous marriages, exiled or restlessly traveling sons: early fiction imagines the possibility of socially inventing ourselves by challenging and leaving behind both the family defined by birth and a place called home. We will examine the ideology of self-invention-its promotion of individual autonomy through education, culture, sex, and economics-in such novels as Defoe's Moll Flanders, Haywood's Love in Excess, Fielding's Tom Jones, Austen's Emma. We will also examine how fiction tries to invent itself by turning to forms of realism and forgetting the history of literature"
ENGL 3345,Modern British Drama on Stage and Screen,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PMA 3745,(LA-AS),,,"A survey of English drama on stage and screen from the late-nineteenth century to the present.  We will examine important dramatic forms and theatrical traditions while considering plays in their historical, cultural, and critical contexts. We will also explore film adaptations of these plays to consider the relationship between stage and screen in the modern era.   Readings/screenings will include works by Shaw, Wilde, Priestley, Churchill, Pinter, Stoppard, and Kane"
ENGL 3360,American Drama and Theatre,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3360, PMA 3757",(LA-AS),,,"Explores major American playwrights from 1900 to 1960, introducing students to American theatre as a significant part of modern American cultural history. We will consider the ways in which theatre has contributed to the construction and deconstruction of a national identity. Similarly, we will examine the influence of the American Theatre on and in film. We will pay special attention to the social, political, and aesthetic contexts of the time period and discuss the shifting popularity of dramatic forms, including melodrama, realism, expressionism, absurdism, and the folk play, in the American theatre canon. Authors include O'Neill, Glaspell, Odets, Rice, Hellman, Hughes, Miller, Williams, and Albee, among others"
ENGL 3525,Twentieth Century American Poetry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 3525,(LA-AS),,,"Twentieth-century poetry has been closely identified with what Ezra Pound famously termed the challenge to ""Make It New."" Yet the question of just what ""making it new"" might mean was hotly contested throughout the century. Why did poets feel the need to make it new? What did making it new mean to people entering the institution of ""poetry"" from different social positions? American poetry diversified as it also rose in international influence. We will look at a number of different forms of poetry developed by poets from the United States, not forgetting to note the extent to which ""Americanism"" was or was not of concern to them in their experiments"
ENGL 3690,The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 3690, FGSS 3691",(CA-AS),,,"Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008. As such, poverty has disproportionately affected women and underrepresented racial and ethnic communities. This course will analyze this issue through its representation in film and literature, both fiction and non-fiction"
ENGL 3740,Contemporary African American Poetry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 3742, ASRC 3740",(LA-AS),,,"This course will examine a variety of voices in contemporary African American poetry, focusing on works produced in the decades following the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements. We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Trethewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon"
ENGL 3762,Law and Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6710, GOVT 6045, LAW 6710",(LA-AS),,,"What can lawyers and judges learn from the study of literature? This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy"
ENGL 3805,Literary Translation: Don't Shoot the Messenger,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This is a creative writing seminar for students wishing to enrich their writer's imagination through the art of literary translation. Whatever gets lost in translation, let's hope that it won't be us. We will examine theories of translation, and the intriguing relationship between author, translator, and text. We will analyze various literary texts and convey them in contemporary English focusing on the nuances of voice, tone, and style. Knowledge of other languages is a plus, but not a requirement"
ENGL 3830,Intermediate Narrative Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,"ENGL 2800 or ENGL 2810 and permission of instructor based on submission of a manuscript (bring manuscript to first day of class, or submit via email, depending upon instructor's preference)",,,(LA-AS),,,"This course focuses upon the writing of fiction or related narrative forms.

May include significant reading and discussion of readings, explorations of form and technique, completion of writing assignments and prompts, and peer review of student work"
ENGL 3860,Philosophic Fictions,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"""Fictions"" of thought and language abound in all good writing, especially in works that deliberately test and play with ideas: dialogues, satires, parables, philosophic tales, and ""thought-experiments."" Students will write critically about such works and will experiment with writing in similar forms in order to argue flexibly, ridicule vice and folly, or involve readers in pleasingly or disturbingly insoluble problems. Readings may include Plato's Gorgias or Republic, Swift's ""Modest Proposal"" and Gulliver's Travels, parables by Jesus and  Kafka, dystopias by Caryl Churchill and George Saunders, science fiction by Octavia Butler and the Wachowski brothers, short stories by Jorge Luis Borges and Flannery O'Connor, and essays by Richard Rorty and Terry Eagleton.

ENGL 3890,The Personal Voice: Nonfiction Writing,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Writers of creative nonfiction plumb the depths of their experience and comment memorably on the passing scene. They write reflectively on themselves and journalistically on the activities and artifacts of others. The voice they seek is at once uniquely personal, objectively persuasive, and accessible to others who want relish their view of the world and learn from it. This course is for the maturely self-motivated writer (beyond the first year of college) who wants to experiment with style and voice to find new writerly personae in a workshop environment. During the semester, we'll read enabling models of literary nonfiction, including one another's, and work to develop a portfolio of diverse and polished writing"
ENGL 4161,Literature of the Crusades,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6161, MEDVL 4161, MEDVL 6161",(LA-AS),(HB),,"The Crusades occupied brief periods, with events far from most Western writers, but kept a long hold on European historical, religious, and literary imagination. This provides an opportunity to consider how literature responds to ideological and military conflict. Exploring the ideas leading to the Crusades, and some narratives from those directly involved, from the Chanson de Roland to other French and Latin chronicles and poems, the course will consider a wide span of later Middle English literature from romances to the works of Chaucer and his contemporaries in order to reconsider the imprint of the Crusades on the wider English literary tradition. Goals include gaining proficiency in Middle English and its literature, as well as theories of how narrative responds to cultural and ideological crisis"
ENGL 4260,The Animal,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4240, GERST 4260, GOVT 4279",(CA-AS),,,"In recent years literary representations and philosophical discussions of the status of the animal vis-à-vis the human have abounded. In this course, we will track the literary phenomenology of animality. In addition we will read philosophical texts that deal with the questions of animal rights and of the metaphysical implications of the ""animal."" Readings may include, among others, Agamben, Aristotle, Berger, the Bible, Calvino, Coetzee, Darwin, Derrida, Descartes, Donhauser, Gorey, Haraway, Hegel, Heidegger, Herzog, Kafka, Kant, La Mettrie, de Mandeville, Montaigne, Nietzsche, Ozeki, Rilke, Schopenhauer, Singer, Sorabji, Sterchi, Stevens, de Waal, Wittgenstein, Wolfe. A reading knowledge of German and French would be helpful"
ENGL 4291,American Shakespeare,4,Graded,,,,"AMST 4194, PMA 4190",,,,"What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton. While encountering a number of plays, students will have the opportunity to see at least three live performances and numerous movies, consider the history of Shakespeare in America and learn from actors, directors, scholars and designers"
ENGL 4313,The Beautiful Struggle: Radical Aesthetics and Politics,4,Graded,Spring,,,AMST 4313,,,,"Now let us begin.  Now let us rededicate ourselves to the long and bitter, but beautiful, struggle for a new world. The course will begin from the declaration made by Martin Luther King, Jr. that the struggle for a new world, inevitably political, is also beautiful, that is, that it is involved with aesthetics. ""The struggle is beautiful, I'm too strong for your slavery,"" raps Talib Kweli, thirty-seven years after King's speech.  What did King mean, and what have others in American culture meant, when they invoked beauty and struggle in the same breath?  What have the arts and radical politics had to do with each other?  When have radical politics and experimental aesthetics needed each other?  We will work with all forms of the arts; discussion will figure heavily in this effort; political and aesthetic theory will surface regularly"
ENGL 4340,Dreaming Romanticism,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 4152,(LA-AS),(HB),,"The story of the Fall, in John Milton's Paradise Lost, is also a story of dreams. Woven into the epic tale of our first encounter with mortality, Adam's and Eve's trances and dream-life tell their own stories within the grand narrative of human beginnings and raise questions about the nature of poetic language in the face of  life and death. In this course we will trace the perplexing stories of these dreams as they pass from Milton to the Romantic poets, whose poetry can be said to rewrite the peculiar relation between falling and dreaming in a new language of mortality and survival. Authors will include John Milton, William Wordsworth, John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Mary Shelley, among others"
ENGL 4491,Romanticism and the Fate of the Senses,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4019, SHUM 4991, STS 4981",,,,"What if, William Blake once asked, every bird that flies ""is an immense world of delight, closed by your senses five?"" Asking what real and possible worlds our habits of sensory perception exclude, Romantic poets criticized their culture's increasing faith in sense-based, empirical knowledge - knowledge supposedly free from subjective bias, historical circumstance, national prejudice, and political complicity. This seminar will focus on poetry as a form of sensory re-training and on Romantic and post-Romantic claims to a politics of perception. Can artworks access rival science, non-human experience, or otherwise unthinkable histories - or sensually suspend the pressure to do so? Readings from Blake, Keats, Dickinson, Goethe, Locke, Foucault, Latour, Daston, Rancière, Bourdieu, Williams, de Man, Adorno, Terada, Stewart, and Hartman"
ENGL 4503,Picturing the U.S. Slave Narrative,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 4503,(LA-AS),,,"Before the advent of technologies like Facebook and Twitter, nineteenth-century viewers used new visual technologies-like collectible card-photographs and illustrated newspapers-to share information or publically debate social problems. In an effort to garner support for slavery's abolition, U.S. anti-slavery activists embraced ""illustrations,"" ""scenes,"" and ""pictures,"" as key rhetorical tools, using them to provide ""ocular proof"" of slavery's horrors and abolition's necessity. Via hands-on interaction with nineteenth-century images, and classroom study of slave narratives, illustrated newspapers, and photo-texts, we will pinpoint how visual images transformed not only the nineteenth-century slave narrative, but also its many literary after-lives. By reading nineteenth-century visual culture against more contemporary representations of slavery like Toni Morrison's 1988 novel Beloved, Kyle Baker's 2005 graphic novel, Nat Turner, and Steve McQueen's 2014 Academy-Award Winning film Twelve Years a Slave, we'll revise how we define a key genre in American literary studies"
ENGL 4510,James Baldwin and Philosophy,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ASRC 4110, ASRC 6110",(LA-AS),,,"As a writer, James Baldwin was active in many genres. Novelist, essayist, cultural commentator, and, of course, critic, are some of them. This course is interested in the ways in which James Baldwin might be said to have taken up philosophical issues in his writing. More simply phrased, what kind of thinking does Baldwin's writing evince? Baldwin, it seems, is never only taking up issues of race, or religion, or the diasporic condition, or critiquing America's failure to live to its own political promise(s). There is always a philosophical question at stake: Baldwin must be thought, at some level, through abstraction to get fully, properly, at the questions Baldwin is trying to address. To this end, this course will read Baldwin's works in relation to some of the criticism – the theoretical responses – that his work has provoked. Baldwin will be read as a religious thinker (the thinker of religion), Baldwin as a thinker of the Civil Rights movement, Baldwin as a film scholar"
ENGL 4522,Magical Realism: Ireland and the Postcolonial World,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course will study transnational cross-pollinations among Irish, Latin American, Indian, and Caribbean writers who transgress the boundaries between the enchantment of fantasy and the seeming rationality of the material world. What role do ghosts, miracles, and wondrous transformations play in the social and aesthetic imagination of nations emerging from colonial oppression? Ireland will form our central case study: Irish writers since the 1940s have drawn on the folk legacy of the Celtic Revival while mixing in new inspiration from the hybrid modes of authors such as Borges and Rushdie. By tracing a line of influence that runs from Joyce to García Márquez to Anne Enright, we will map the circulation of the uncanny and the uncontainable across the crumbling borders of the contemporary globe"
ENGL 4575,"""The Hero Can't Be Dead Until the Last Reel"": Caribbean Cinema and Society",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 4575,(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course will trace the early cinema of the Caribbean (""The Harder They Come,"" ""Black Shack Alley,"" etc.) up to recent 'new wave' films (""Better Mus' Come,"" ""SistaGod,"" etc.), within context of the Caribbean's socio-political, historical, and literary trends. Along with regular viewing of films and listening to music, several fiction and non-fiction texts will be studied. Close attention will be paid to how the 'cinematic gaze' represents a society which is still defining itself since the end of the colonial period"
ENGL 4603,Black Women Writers of the South,4,Graded,,,,"ASRC 4403, ASRC 6403, FGSS 4403, FGSS 6403",,,,"This course considers the new generation of writers of black women that has emerged in the U.S. South in more recent years, whose writings have increasingly impacted the development of contemporary African American literature. Genres that we will explore include the novel, poetry and essay and memoir. We will consider a range of authors, including Tayari Jones, Shay Youngblood, Honorée Jeffers, and Natasha Tretheway. Concomitantly, we will explore the visual art of Kara Walker. We will consider ways in which these writers build upon established themes and conventions in African American and black women's writing and the implications of their work for black feminist theory.   Furthermore, we will examine the impact of their work within the emergent field of twenty-first century African American literature and criticism"
ENGL 4700,Reading Joyce's Ulysses,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 4831,(LA-AS),,,"A thorough episode-by-episode study of the art and meaning of Joyce's masterwork Ulysses, the most influential book of the twentieth century. We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce's canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture. No previous experience with Joyce is required"

We will examine major theoretical texts in relation to their historical contexts and more recent attempts to expand the field in new directions, including terrorism, nuclear threat, ecological catastrophe, neuroscience, legal contexts, political discourse, theological discourse, and non-Western contexts.. Questions will concern the nature of history, event, and testimonial archive as well as the changing question of (the language of) witness in a world in which traumatic repetition is bound up with historical erasure.

ENGL 6553,Erotics of Instruction,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,LGBT 6553,,,,"Instruction is a sensual experience with innumerable orientations: teaching, learning, analyzing, interrogating, suspecting, lecturing, suggesting, introducing, initiating, mentoring, indoctrinating, exhibiting, proving, disproving, discrediting, discovering, disavowing, and always, always discussing. We will discuss a range of classic texts on the relation of pleasure, power, and knowledge in the erotics of instruction, inside the classroom and out. We will begin with Plato's Symposium and trace its reimagination and critique through psychoanalytic, deconstructive, feminist, and queer theory. In this framework, we will explore works of erotic philosophy by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, David Halperin, Jane Gallop, and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, among others, as well as related works of contemporary cinema. "

This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy"
ENGL 6941,Twenty-First Century African American Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 6941,,,,"This seminar will examine novels, drama, poetry, and theory tied to 21st-century black aesthetics.

The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists"
ENGL 7412,Law and Humanities Colloquium,3,Graded,Spring,,,LAW 7412,,,,"In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, the fields that comprise the humanities are engaging in new ways with law as well as with each other, and projects developed within the context of law schools themselves bear renewed relevance to the humanities. This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. Those who present materials will be asked to speak not only about their specific research but also to address where their work is situated within new developments in law and humanities as a whole.  The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of the history of law and humanities to date and to situate current developments within this history. We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself.  Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion. Everyone who wishes to take the course for credit must attend the first class"

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

We'll then look at Augustine's  Confessions - where Christian conversion  becomes an even more startling kind of transformation - before proceeding to the stories of shape-shifters gathered together by the twelfth-century French poet Marie de France.  Then we'll take a look at Dante's account of metamorphosis as retribution in Inferno, as well as the kinds of transformations fantasized in the margins of medieval manuscripts, as Michael Camille describes them in Image on the Edge. We'll finally take the time to engage with both the transfiguration of Christ in medieval thought and its close analogue, stigmatization, as undergone most famously by Francis of Assisi.

Since when do people travel and write about their travels?  What do they write about their journeys, and for whom?  What is at stake in such literature?  This course is an ""Invitation to the Voyage"" (Baudelaire) in all of its forms (including initiation trips, road trips, business trips, exploration trips, leisure trips, spiritual journeys or journeys without purpose) and to the exploration of its literary implications.  Through readings of travel journals and fictions based on journeys, this course questions the relationships between traveling and writing.  It will trace back travel literature from the 16th century (J. Cartier) to recent publications (S. Tesson), via the generation of ""Bourlingueurs"" at the end of the 19th century (Cendrars, Segalen).  Alongside this ""journey"" through centuries of Francophone literature, a particular attention will be given to the 18th century (Bougainville, Montesquieu, Voltaire) and, in the 19th century, to the birth of orientalism.  In the 20th century, the course will question more particularly the relationships between travels and migrations.  Alongside the literary material, the course will also cover a large variety of media (blogs, essays, movies, songs, paintings and photography in particular) in order to study the extent to which literature contributes to the experience of traveling, as well as how travel influences writing practices"
FREN 3470,The Figure of the Outsider in French Cinema,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course will trace the changing character of the outsider in French cinema from early realist film to the present day. In opposition to the dominant bourgeois ideals of economic security and social homogeneity, in these films the outsider emerges as someone who cannot, or will not, play by the rules. We will begin with the satirical critiques of bourgeois life through the figure of the bumbling ingrate in the films of Renoir and Tati, then exploring the nouvelle vague of the 1960s and 1970s, its outsiders excapsulating the disenchantments of the post-war generation: Godard's existential gangster, Varda's wandering actress, Truffaut's ménage à trois, Resnais's disturbed Algerian veteran, and Chabrol's disloyal wife. Next, we will address the figure of the immigrant outsider, who does not chose to be separate but rather has exclusion thrust upon them, in Yamina Benguigui's documentary Mémoires d'immigrés and Abdellatif Kechiche's La Graine et le mulet. Finally, we will look at the violence of social exclusion and the volatile and threatening outsiders it seems to produce, figures who linger menacingly on the edges of a comfortable bourgeois world: Mathieu Kassovitz's La Haine, Michael Haneke's Caché and Jacques Audiard's Un prophète. Along the way, we will get to know the way the genres, techniquess and cinematic personalities that have shaped Fench cinema as we know it today"

Their success is indicated by the interest prominent philosophers have taken in their work and the many musical settings their poetry has inspired.

A comparison of student movements in West Germany and elsewhere will highlight the West German specifics (e.g., protest against ""Notstandsgesetze""; demands to confront the Nazi-past; politicization of the private; the 1972 ""Radikalenerlass""). Radical politics culminated in the 1977 ""German Autumn"". Novels and films in recent years testify to an ongoing fascination with the RAF (Red Army Faction), be it in the form of depoliticized 'radical chic' or in the form of serious debates over historiography, personal fates of victims and perpetrators.

From 1914-1945, the continent witnessed an extraordinary entanglement of inter-state wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, civil wars and genocides.  Originating as a classical inter-state conflict, the Great War led to a Weltanschaungskrieg. In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of ""European Civil War"" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an ""age of  extremes"" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination.

Given this level of attention, there are surprisingly few settled answers to questions about what happened between 1914 and 1918. Did Germany seek war in 1914? What would have happened if Franz Ferdinand had not been assassinated? What was the role of the Schlieffen Plan? Why did the United States intervene?

Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests"

We derive the Ordinary Least Squares estimator and its characteristics using matrix algebra and determine the conditions under which it achieves statistical optimality. We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference. Some time will be spent reviewing matrix algebra, and discussing ways to implement computations using statistical software"

We will be particularly interested in the foundational assumptions that underpin the connections between empirical reality, language, and statistical analysis. While these foundational assumptions are often taken for granted by social scientists, they vary dramatically between social science disciplines.  The implicit contradiction between that variance and their doxic acceptance within disciplines will be a primary focus of the course"

Topics to be discussed will include value pluralism, disagreement and dissensus, the politics of identity\difference, the role of religion in democratic politics, the relationship between affect and political conviction, and the turn to ethics in political theory.

While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law.

HIST 1104,FWS: Empire and Democracy: Ancient to Modern,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Classical Athens and the Roman Republic were governed by democratic institutions which were unprecedented in scale and exceptional in the demands placed on their citizens. Democracy also went hand in hand with war: under forms of democratic governance, both Athens and Rome formed empires and pursued policies that brought their citizens into a war of some kind almost every year. This course will focus on the connections between democracy and imperialism based on primary sources, including Herodotus, Thucydides, Aristotle, Polybius, Cicero, and Livy. By engaging directly with the ancient sources, writing assignments will explore theories of imperialism, the nature of Athenian and Roman political institutions, interactions with subject peoples, and the strains of war on society. We will conclude the course with comparisons to American democracy"
HIST 1105,FWS: Centuries of Bloodshed? Violence in the Middle Ages,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"The supposedly widespread violence of the Middle Ages frequently captures modern attention. Graphic violence is often a selling point for medieval-themed media, such as HBO's Game of Thrones series.  Often, medieval violence seems to be pointless and cruel; a barbaric aspect of a less civilized time. Was violence in the Middle Ages as senseless as it seems to us? How did the denizens of the Middle Ages experience this violence? Were they as appalled or intrigued by it as we seem to be? This course will consider the way medieval authors interpreted and represented violence in a variety of genres including history, law, and literature"

One observer has argued that even in countries with ""nothing to celebrate,"" all jubilee nations eventually featured ""some form of official commemoration."" Why were these commemorations so important to Africans? Why does nationalism continue to catalyze such heated debate, in Africa as around the world?  What does ""independence"" mean anyway? This course examines the tension over who gets to define ""the nation"" in Africa and why. The goal will be to analyze historical debates on ""the nation"" in Africa and to write persuasive arguments assessing them"
HIST 1110,"FWS: Paper Politics: Writing in India, 1700-Present",3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"The Indian subcontinent poses a paradox in histories of the written word.

Yet what institutional and social contexts have informed the cultures of writing in South Asia? We address this question through historical and anthropological perspectives. Readings and discussions will focus on the worlds of the Mughal scribe, the colonial book printer, and the bazaar public sphere. We shall learn of the written labor of subordinate clerks and peons, and follow the paper trail to the halls of postcolonial bureaucratic offices. Our aim will thus be to understand the dynamics of writing and power that have historically constituted state and popular politics in South Asia"

Written assignments will involve close readings of Gandhi's work with an eye toward engaging whether his ideas translate to being a modern and morally responsible individual in the early twenty-first century"

This course seeks to answer these questions by exploring the history of modern Europe. Among other themes, we will discuss the Protestant Reformation, the rise of absolutism, the Enlightenment, the French Revolution, industrialism, colonialism, the Russian Revolution, the two world wars, decolonization and immigration, May '68, and the construction of the European Union. In conjunction, we will examine how modern ideologies (liberalism, Marxism, imperialism, conservatism, fascism, totalitarianism) were developed and challenged. Through a wide array of historical documents (fiction, letters, philosophy, treatises, manifestos, films, and art), we will consider why ""old Europe"" is still relevant for us today"

HIST 2085,The Enlightenment: The Birth of Modern Thought,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(HA-AS),(HB),,"Until the 18th century, criminals and heretics were tortured and killed before large crowds of spectators, Jews and other outcasts were required to wear special badges and segregated from the rest of society, and Kings were thought to be the representatives of God's majesty on earth. In the middle of the 18th century, these and other long-standing traditions came under attack by a cultural and intellectual revolution known as ""The Enlightenment."" In reading circles, coffee houses, and salons from Paris and London to Philadelphia, a new system of thought developed and spread throughout Europe and the colonies. Through the writings of Voltaire, Rousseau, Montesquieu, and others, we will explore the radical ideas about politics, religion, law, race, and gender by which intellectuals claimed to be sweeping away the ""barbarism"" of the old world and ushering in the modern ""Age of Reason."""
HIST 2131,Energy in History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,STS 2231,(HA-AS),,,"In this seminar, we will explore the role of energy as a force in the driving of history.  With the widespread harnessing of fossil fuels in the nineteenth century as our pivot point, we will consider both the prior energy regimes of wood, wind, water, and human and animal muscle, as well as the politics of energy production and consumption from the industrial age to the present.  While attentive to issues of environmental impact, we will also examine the broader implications of energy use for social, economic, and political structures across time.  Readings will consist of both classic works and recent scholarship, with cases drawn from all around the globe"
HIST 2251,U.S. Immigration Narratives,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2251, LSP 2251",(HA-AS),(HB),,"Americans are conflicted about immigration.  We honor and celebrate (and commercialize) our immigrant heritage in museums, folklife festivals, parades, pageants, and historical monuments. We also build fences and detention centers, and pass more and more laws to bar access to the United States. Polls tell us that Americans are concerned about the capacity of the United States to absorb so many immigrants from around the world. How often have we heard the laments ""Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate"" or ""My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?"" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to ""become Americans""? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency? This seminar will explore these issues and help students discern fact from fiction"
HIST 2542,The Making of Contemporary Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 2542,(HA-AS),(GB),,"Most people learn about Africa through the media.  However, media critics note that coverage is disproportionately skewed toward negative stories - poverty, war and corruption. While these factors are a reality for too many people on the continent, media observers note that too often the coverage lacks context and breadth.  Furthermore, media outlets do not report positive developments even where they exist.  This course will provide some of the depth and context necessary to understand events in contemporary Africa.  The first two-thirds of the course will examine African social and economic history since the nineteenth century - Africa's integration in the international economy, the rise of new social classes, the creation of the colonial state and the post-colonial state.  Our primary examples will be drawn from  East, West and Southern Africa to highlight both the similarities and differences of their historical development.  The final third of the course will examine several contemporary issues in which scholars and journalists have attempted to address the weaknesses in general press coverage"
HIST 2581,Environmental History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2581, BSOC 2581",(HA-AS),(HB),,"This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students"
HIST 2660,Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIS 2660, AMST 2660",(HA-AS),(HB),,"One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills"

HIST 4291,Marriage and Divorce in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 4291, FGSS 4291",(HA-AS),(GB),,"Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change.

HIST 4393,The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4393, ASRC 4393, HIST 6393",(HA-AS),(HB),,"In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the ""General Strike"" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion"

This course will examine different perspectives on a period when Eastern and Southeastern Europe were at the center of a contest between competing empires and emerging nation-states. Readings will be mostly primary sources by Russian, Polish, Turkish, Greek, Ukrainian, Arab, Bulgarian, German and other authors. Themes will include the emergence of pan-Slavism and pan-Turanism, federative schemes, how ideologies such as fascism and communism influenced interstate relations, and the cultural progeny (literature, art, music, etc.) of visions for a future regional order"
HIST 4544,WWI & the Emergence of the Modern Middle East,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"HIST 6544, NES 4641, NES 6641",(HA-AS),(GB),,"It is hard to think of a region in the world that changed more drastically during the course of World War I, than that of the Middle East. For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders. Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences. This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century. Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism. A basic background in the history of the region is strongly preferred, but not required"

From 1914-1945, the continent witnessed an extraordinary entanglement of inter-state wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, civil wars and genocides.  Originating as a classical inter-state conflict, the Great War led to a Weltanschaungskrieg. In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of ""European Civil War"" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an ""age of  extremes"" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination. This course will analyze some features of this cataclysmic time by engaging political theory, cultural and intellectual history"

What was the impact of the war on the subsequent history of North America and the wider world?  Students will approach such questions from a variety of disciplinary approaches, including military history, the mobilization of economic resources, center-periphery political relations, and the involvement of indigenous nations - with an eye toward assessing the long-term consequences of the war and its enduring, complex, and contested legacy in popular memory (particularly the recently-completed 250th anniversary commemoration).  The course will emphasize critical interpretation of a rich array of primary documents and published scholarship, and each student will complete an independent research essay based on original sources"

In assessing these entangled histories we will identify and question the sources of entanglement (where did the entanglement originate?), the geographic reach of the entanglement (was it Atlantic or pan-American in scope?), and the historiographical consequences of privileging certain types of entanglement (what does a historiographical map of the Atlantic tell us about the entangled nature of the histories of the Atlantic and the Americas? Is the map reflecting historical realities or the geographical spread of historians' fields of expertise?). The assigned readings will help us tackle these questions and to discuss key themes in transnational history like the spread of information across political boundaries, the transnational impacts of revolutionary movements, the participation of subalterns in transnational communication networks, and the emergence and evolution of cosmopolitanism"

While the first two decisions were perceived as a step back in the fight against racial discrimination, the repeal of DOMA was welcomed by mainstream LGBT-rights organizations as a decisive move towards equality. One of the goals of this seminar is to think these rulings together instead of treating them as separate entities. How did the struggle for sexual rights and the promotion of color blindness come to coexist so easily within the law? In order to understand how liberalism has operated historically and theoretically as a crucial site of regulation for sexuality and race, we will read texts from a wide range of contexts and disciplines including political theory, anthropology, literature, philosophy, history, and law.

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for ""managing diversity"" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the ""business case"" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion"

We will begin the course with a discussion of the importance of this problem - for people with disabilities, employers, and for society at large - and then discuss employment legislation that has been passed in an effort to improve the employment of people with disabilities. A major component of this legislation has to do with reasonable accommodations, yet there continues to be insufficient understanding of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation and the likely costs associated with providing these accommodations, both of which we will cover in the third week of the course. We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities.

(Seven weeks),ILRHR 5600,,ILRHR 4440,,,,"What is the future of work in America?  Is it what we want it to be?   If not, why not and what can be done about it?  This course addresses these questions, motivated by the concern that those just now entering the workforce are inheriting a mess that, unless reversed, promises to deliver a future in which many, if not most, will experience a lower standard of living than their parents.  The course is a local adaptation of a course developed and conducted by Professor Thomas Kochan at MIT's Sloan School titled ""How the Next Generation can Secure the American Dream"" (#15.662).  Both courses, in turn, are part of a larger initiative aimed first at getting a firm handle on the younger generation's definition of the ""American Dream"" and then at mobilizing cross-generational efforts to secure the key components of the dream.  The MIT course employs ""blended learning"" (i.e., a mix of online and classroom experiences).  Thus, we have an opportunity to tap into its online portion asynchronously (i.e., week by week at our convenience), and use these resources as well as other related materials and guest speakers from the ILR faculty and elsewhere to guide and enrich in-class discussions.  Key topics covered include: current opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. workforce, the nature of the old (post WW II) social contract between employers and employees and the conditions that made it possible, how that social contract has been eroded by subsequent developments (globalization, technology 2.0, etc.), and steps that might be taken to achieve a more desirable future state"

We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights"

Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools. All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary"

We will consider frameworks for conjoining literature with law that are established (narratology, psychoanalysis, rhetoric) and new (cultural studies, performance, globalization), applying these analytics to specific issues (immigration, marriage, human rights) as well as literary texts. We will thereby investigate the evolution of law and literature as a field of inquiry, examining its institutional-intellectual genesis and its contemporary formations. While ranging across historical periods, we will in particular ask about the future directions of law and literature. To what emerging debates might law and literature scholars turn? What new methodologies and problems remain insufficiently explored?"

LAW 6822,Social Science and the Law,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course examines the relationship of social science to law, focusing on the growing use of social science in the legal system. Over the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have conducted systematic research on the operation of law and legal institutions.

Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation. Are social scientists asking the right questions? Are lawyers, judges, legislators, and legal reformers using social science findings appropriately?

LAW 7412,Law and Humanities Colloquium,3,Graded,Spring,,,ENGL 7412,,,,"In an era of increasing interdisciplinary collaboration, the fields that comprise the humanities are engaging in new ways with law as well as with each other, and projects developed within the context of law schools themselves bear renewed relevance to the humanities. This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. Those who present materials will be asked to speak not only about their specific research but also to address where their work is situated within new developments in law and humanities as a whole.  The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of the history of law and humanities to date and to situate current developments within this history. We will, for example, read classics of the law and literature movement by James Boyd White and Robert Cover, then inquire as to how recent work-such as the essays in Victoria Kahn and Lorna Hutson's collection Rhetoric and Law in Early Modern Europe-might differ in approach. The rest of the course will be organized around a series of speakers, some drawn from Cornell and some from other universities. The students will convene for a half hour at the beginning of the session, which will then be opened to a larger community, including faculty members, for the talk itself.  Students will be required to write six three- to five-page papers responding to the speakers' pre-circulated talks; these will be due in advance of the class session and shown to those lecturing in order to prompt and enhance discussion.

LAW 7580,"Markets, Morals, and Methods",3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"This seminar is devoted to the foundations of choice, agency, and welfare -- matters that lie at the core of normative legal and economic theory. Readings, guest speakers, and class discussion will focus on the nature of preferences, reasons, and norms, as well as (a) their inter-relations and (b) their roles in guiding human decision and action. A central theme will be the question whether and to what degree welfare, well-being, and wealth for that matter can be understood apart from and even as determinative of normative propriety (""rightness"" and ""wrongness""), or whether instead these concepts presuppose a prior conception of normative propriety. Many legal and economic theorists seem to assume the former, but this assumption can -- and in this course will -- be examined critically"
LAW 7672,Race and the Criminal Justice System,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This seminar will try to answer one of the most sensitive questions facing Americans today: Why are African Americans grossly over-represented in the American criminal justice system? Some answer this question with a simple accusation that the system is racist in design and implementation, and point to familiar statistics to buttress their claim. African Americans are eight times more likely to be incarcerated than whites. As of 2004, over 12% of African American men between the ages of 25 and 29 were in custody. For under-educated young black men, the incarceration rates are simply astounding: in 2000, nearly one in five African-American men under 41 who had not attended college were in prison or jail. Yet these statistics, as dispiriting as they are, must open the debate, not end it. While no one credibly doubts the persistence of racially biased decision-making throughout the criminal justice system, careful empirical research strongly suggests that overt discrimination plays a relatively modest role in producing the current state of play. The explanations for the disparities that haunt the criminal justice system are nuanced and complex, and therefore deserving of careful study. Absorbing lessons from a wide variety of disciplines, including history, sociology, political science, economics, and law, this seminar will try to shed light on this vexing American problem. Attendance, preparation, and participation are mandatory. Because the literature on this topic is voluminous, the readings for each class will range across a wide field. I expect the time commitment to be substantial. Still, there are no special course requirements. Grades will be based on class participation (15%) and a research paper (85%) due at the end of term. As part of the course, I will try to arrange a tour of a Maximum Security Prison, the timing of which will be determined once registration is complete and we have a roster of students. To accommodate the visit, the reading schedule may be adjusted as needed"

LAW 7785,War Crimes Trials and the Law of Genocide,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Beginning in November 1945, in an unprecedented attempt to bring war criminals to justice, more than 20 senior government officials and military leaders of Hitlerʼs Third Reich were indicted and tried, in what has become known as the Nuremberg Trial, for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 ""Justice Trial"" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland.

LAW 7801,Immigration Appellate Law and Advocacy Clinic,4,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"Students will write appellate briefs to the Board of Immigration Appeals on behalf of clients who have petitioned to remain in the United States because they fear persecution or torture in their home countries. These clients will typically have represented themselves pro se in Immigration Court. During the first part of the semester students will learn substantive and procedural asylum and Convention Against Torture (CAT) law, such as the nature of persecution, grounds for asylum and CAT claims, and the practical and social effects that these laws have on new immigrants who seek asylum or CAT relief. Classes may also cover practical knowledge needed for effective representation, such as advanced research and writing skills.

How often have we heard the laments ""Today's immigrants are too different. They don't want to assimilate"" or ""My grandparents learned English quickly, why can't they?"" The assumption is that older generations 'Americanized' quickly but that today's immigrants do not want to assimilate. Did 19th century immigrants really migrate to the United States to ""become Americans""? Did they really assimilate quickly? Are today's immigrants really all that different from the immigrants who arrived earlier? Why do these particular narratives have such power and currency?

We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights"

We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

We'll then look at Augustine's  Confessions - where Christian conversion  becomes an even more startling kind of transformation - before proceeding to the stories of shape-shifters gathered together by the twelfth-century French poet Marie de France.  Then we'll take a look at Dante's account of metamorphosis as retribution in Inferno, as well as the kinds of transformations fantasized in the margins of medieval manuscripts, as Michael Camille describes them in Image on the Edge. We'll finally take the time to engage with both the transfiguration of Christ in medieval thought and its close analogue, stigmatization, as undergone most famously by Francis of Assisi.

NBA 5140,Ethics and Corporate Culture,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"In the high-pressure worlds of business and law, all too often good people do bad things.  In many cases, the unethical behavior is due in part to a toxic corporate culture. The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where ""only results matter,"" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior.

NBA 5200,Retail Operations,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"This course is designed as a half-semester elective course for MBA students. It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures"

Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history"

For the war not only spelled the end of an empire that had united the region for well over 400 years, but it also meant the creation of new national borders, new state structures, colonial occupation, the entrenchment of settler colonialism, and a drastic upheaval in traditional socio-cultural orders. Despite the important role that the Ottoman Empire played in the war, and the deep and long-lasting impact the war had on the region, academic interests in the Great War has mostly focused on European experiences. This seminar, which will be offered in conjunction with a number of events taking place on campus, will turn the spotlight onto this important topic. Even though classic texts will be used in this seminar, the focus will be on newer scholarship dealing with the social and political history of the Ottoman Empire on the eve of the war, the experience of the war on the frontline and at home in the Middle East, and the impact of the war on the region in the first half of the 20th century. Thematically, the course will focus on trials of imperialism at the end of the 19th century, the study of the emergence of new forms of complex identifications in the region, the long-term impact of colonialism, and the emergence of nationalism.

Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written. Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools.

Firms provide a structure through which people can organize themselves into those groups or teams. They are categorized by the nature of the property rights owners hold in the firm, and by the details of the firm's contractual arrangements. Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans. State corporate law and anti-takeover devices are also discussed. The role and impact of federal policies, such as the 1933-34 Exchange Acts, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and the Dodd-Frank Act in affecting corporate structure and managerial behavior will be an important focus.

PHIL 1440,Ethics of Eating,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"We all face difficult moral decisions on occasion. This course introduces students to the idea that we face such a decision several times a day in deciding what to eat. How should facts about animal life and death inform this decision? Is the suffering involved in meat, egg, and dairy production really bad enough to make the practices immoral? How do our dietary choices affect local and non-local economies, the environment, and other people generally? Finally, given the deep connections between eating practices and various ethnic, religious and class identities, how can we implement a reasonable food policy for an expanding world population while also respecting these important differences? The goal of this course is not to teach some preferred set of answers to these questions. The goal is rather to give participants the basic tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on the questions themselves. These tools include a working knowledge of the major moral theories developed by philosophers, and an understanding of basic empirical issues related to food production, distribution, consumption, and disposal.

Some specific questions that we will consider are: In what ways and to what extent are Americans economically unequal? What are the major causes of American inequality and poverty? To what extent should inequality and poverty be changed by political means?  How should governments deal with religious diversity and other differences in ultimate values, which give rise, for example, to radically different attitudes toward abortion, sexuality, and the preservation of unspoiled nature?  Moral argument, empirical findings and theories of social causes interact in the search for answers to these questions.

Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present.

While Locke likened the newborn's mind to a blank slate, Freud compared the mind to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems. More recently, many have endorsed Turing's proposal that the mind is a computer. Why is this idea attractive and what exactly is a computer? Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway? Could a machine ever count as a person and make choices based on its own free will? Is it really so clear that we have this kind of free will?"

Anscombe's paper (published in 1958) played an important role in animating the approach to ethics now known as virtue ethics, according to which the cultivation of character gains emphasis over ethical principles, rules, and formulas. This course will be a detailed excursion into virtue ethics as it has developed over the last fifty-odd years, along with other, similarly eclectic approaches which elude straightforward categorization.

Departing from an analysis of forms of devotion towards the 'Alid members of prophet Muhammad's family (scriptures and ritual), class discussions will address issues such as constructions of sectarian identities (Sunni versus Shi'i), the role of transnational flows in shaping Shi'i communities across the region, Muslim-majority governments' reactions to the emergence of such communities, and broader debates on orthodoxy and 'deviation' (both within and between Islamic traditions). Although lectures at the beginning will cover the historical process by which Shi'i Islam came into shape, this will be pursued critically, and students are expected to have foundational knowledge of Islam's theology and history"

We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did. The course operates as an intellectual history of the rise of the study of religion as an academic (as opposed to confessional) subject"

To what extent did Dan Brown's The Da Vinci Code draw from ancient Christian gnostic sources? This seminar will explore answers to these questions and many others by focusing on the complex array of literary sources from late antiquity-primarily from a cache of manuscripts found at Nag Hammadi, Egypt, in 1945-that have long been associated with a so-called ""Christian Gnosticism."" Church Fathers condemned the ""movement"" on a variety of grounds, but in this course we will not simply read the condemnations written by the opponents of gnostic thought; rather, we will focus our attention on reading (in English translation) substantial portions of the ""gnostic"" texts written by the adherents themselves. We will give special attention to the ways in which conflicts about Gnosticism connected with conflicts about gender, heresy, power, and authority. To set these texts within a socio-historical context, we will discuss the possible Jewish and hellenistic roots of early Christian Gnosticism and ties to Stoic and other ancient philosophical movements"
RELST 4776,Talmud and the Art of Reading,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"CLASS 4637, JWST 4776, NES 4776",(LA-AS),(GB),,"The Babylonian Talmud has long been viewed as the central text of post-Biblical Judaism. Yet little is known about who wrote it and when it was written. Since the Talmud is an extremely difficult text to master, its readership has therefore until recently been limited to few expert traditional scholars. Over the past fifty or so years, with the advent of translations and study guides, the Talmud has gained increasing popularity. The Talmud has long been viewed as a source for history, law, or moral lessons. But literature interacts with the cultures that produce and read it in far more nuanced and significant ways. In the past century, advances in theories of how and why to read literature have opened up new avenues for understanding what the Talmud says and, more importantly, how it works . This course will examine provocative, bizarre, and salacious Talmud passages through the lens of the evolution of the major theoretical schools of the past century. Each week we will explore a theoretical movement ( e.g. New Criticism, Formalism, Post-Stucturalism, Feminist Criticism, New Historicism , etc .) and apply their reading strategies to close readings of Talmud passages. We will simultaneously read the work of modern Talmud scholars whose reading practices align with each of these theoretical schools. All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud or Critical Theory is necessary"

From 1914-1945, the continent witnessed an extraordinary entanglement of inter-state wars, revolutions and counter-revolutions, civil wars and genocides.  Originating as a classical inter-state conflict, the Great War led to a Weltanschaungskrieg. In spite of its highly controversial uses, the concept of ""European Civil War"" is probably the must useful in order to sum up such an ""age of  extremes"" in which wars have no rules: they become wars against civilians, politics makes groups into implacable enemies and an endemic violence deeply reshaped both cultures and collective imagination.

In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  "

SOC 1101,Introduction to Sociology,3,Stdnt Opt,"Fall, spring, summer",,,,(SBA-AS),,Students may not receive credit for both SOC 1101 and DSOC 1101,"This course introduces classical and contemporary sociological perspectives.  We will begin by considering (mainly classical) perspectives which focus on macro-level features of society (e.g., population, the economy) and the sweeping changes that have occurred within them over the past couple of centuries.  Particular attention will be paid to changes in social cohesion, the division of labor, the spatial organization of society, and technology. These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester"

What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era"

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.  This course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program.

In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies.

To what extent should inequality and poverty be changed by political means?  How should governments deal with religious diversity and other differences in ultimate values, which give rise, for example, to radically different attitudes toward abortion, sexuality, and the preservation of unspoiled nature?  Moral argument, empirical findings and theories of social causes interact in the search for answers to these questions.

SOC 3710,Comparative Social Inequalities,3,Graded,Spring,Introductory social science course,,DSOC 3700,(SBA-AS),,,"The course begins by identifying the origins of social inequality within the transition to agricultural society. Second, the course describes how inequality is reconfigured by the transition from agriculture to industry. Contemporary social science perspectives on industrial society are then entertained, and it is acknowledged that there is a lack of consensus about the portent of rising inequality that began during the late 20th Century. To frame this question, the course embarks upon a comparative historical analysis of industrialization to determine where society may be heading. Because the trend in inequality suggests that a new social order is in the making, the course ultimately asks, ""What might be contours of the new social order?"""

Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them.

What stories did they tell? How did their connection to writing, remembering, lovemaking, or ruling one's kingdom, to name but a few examples, play out metaphorically in cloth? And how did fabrics depend on or transform the transmission of techniques, fashions and motives, but also gender, concepts of the body or the built environment?"

In the Pygmalion myth, the artist's creating hand and the viewer's desire to touch come together in a fantasy of union with the object that has been endlessly appropriated and reimagined in later Western culture. Focusing on Classical art, this course explores the role of touch and embodiment in the viewing and reception of art objects, drawing on ancient models of sense-perception as well as 20th Century theorists such as Reigl, Berenson and Merleau-Ponty.  "
