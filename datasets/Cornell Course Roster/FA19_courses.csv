AAS 2100,South Asian Diaspora,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ANTHR 2410,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could ""culture"" serve as the basis for a shared identity?"

AAS 2910,It's All Chinese to Me,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 2910, ENGL 2910",(CA-AS),,,"In her memoir Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong Kingston identified a conundrum familiar to many US-born children of Chinese immigrants when she asked: ""What is Chinese tradition and what is the movies?"" What is ""Chinese tradition""? Does it mean the same thing to people in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or to Chinese diasporic communities in North America?  Does ""Chineseness"" change across time and space?

The first half of the course seeks to understand that diversity in American politics and foreign policy viewed through the prisms of region, ideology, region, race, class and religion. The second half inquires into the U.S. and American engagement of different world regions and civilizations: Europe, Russia, North America, Latin America, China, Japan, India and the Middle East. U.S. hard power and American soft power find expression in far-reaching processes of American-infused globalization and U.S.-centered anti-Americanism reverberating around the world.

How did we end up being the nation that incarcerates more of its population than virtually any other? What policy processes directly and indirectly account for this? What explains the change that we now appear to be experiencing? What is the future of the U.S. prison system? What is the future of our democracy?

AMST 6631,American Poetry: 1950-2000,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ENGL 6631,,,,"This course will explore postwar US poetry through the lens of what might be called micro-periodization. Taking the decade as a privileged frame of reference, we'll ask what recognizable shifts in style, institutional placement, and cultural value occur as we move from the 50s to the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. These temporal modulations will serve as an alternative to the spatial demarcations that have typically shaped accounts of postwar poetry—e.g., by region, school, movement, etc.  We'll consider, for example, how the loosely paratactic style that emerges in the 50s (Ginsberg, Lowell, Bishop) gives way in the 60s to a lyric mode that blends epiphany and epigram (Merwin, Wright, Creeley), yielding in turn to a more discursive style in the 70s (Ammons, Ashbery, Rich)"

The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory. Finally, the course concludes by analyzing the relationship between the study of Islam, gender, and empire"

While participant observation remains the cornerstone of ethnography, literary, archival, and other written works are increasingly being utilized as primary sources within the anthropological project. This course will hence offer an overview of anthropological works that trace the intersections between cultural production and the literary imagination. Rather than consider the literary elements of ethnography itself, we will strive to understand the disparate forms of social phenomena—both knowledge and practices—that arise from texts and textual practices specifically. Examples include analyses of literary cultures, media forms and non-traditional textual sources, bureaucratic structures, the use of archives, and more. Particular attention will be paid to works based in the Middle East and the Islamic world. By examining the different theoretical, political, and ethical considerations of using the written word as ethnographic evidence, we will be able to shed light on the anthropological project as a whole"

How and why does epidemic unfold? This senior seminar offers an interdisciplinary exploration of infectious diseases.  Our investigations take us from medieval Europe's ""Black Plague,"" to Tuberculosis in early twentieth century United States and its global resurgence at the turn of the twenty-first, to Ebola and its ongoing, periodic outbreaks today. We consider the consequences epidemics have for how we live and imagine shared ecological futures.  Examining work from the life sciences, social sciences, and arts & humanities, we explore the ways in which life and death, disease and survivability, health and thriving are shaped by infectious microbes, embodied eco-social forces, and contingent regimes of knowledge-power. "

This seminar centers on two intersecting areas of inquiry. The first deals with the nature of global movements: how people, ideas, arts, and capital move through world. Engaging postcolonial theory and scholarship on contemporary migration and transnationalism, we will interrogate the idea of borders and nations as well as those categories—like diaspora—that surpass or circumvent them. The second addresses how and why we might study these processes ethnographically.

While participant observation remains the cornerstone of ethnography, literary, archival, and other written works are increasingly being utilized as primary sources within the anthropological project.  This course will hence offer an overview of anthropological works that trace the intersections between cultural production and the literary imagination. Rather than consider the literary elements of ethnography itself, we will strive to understand the disparate forms of social phenomena—both knowledge and practices—that arise from texts and textual practices specifically. Examples include analyses of literary cultures, media forms and non-traditional textual sources, bureaucratic structures, the use of archives, and more. Particular attention will be paid to works based in the Middle East and the Islamic world. By examining the different theoretical, political, and ethical considerations of using the written word as ethnographic evidence, we will be able to shed light on the anthropological project as a whole"

This seminar centers on two intersecting areas of inquiry. The first deals with the nature of global movements: how people, ideas, arts, and capital move through world. Engaging postcolonial theory and scholarship on contemporary migration and transnationalism, we will interrogate the idea of borders and nations as well as those categories—like diaspora—that surpass or circumvent them. The second addresses how and why we might study these processes ethnographically. Here we will consider the potential and limitations of multi-sited and global ethnography, and question the possibility of an activist ethnography of global interconnection.

Until recent decades, there were almost no serious ethnographies of Jewish communities. Today there is a rich new literature in this field.  We will read widely to become familiar with this new literature, exploring the politics of ethnography; memoir as an ethnographic source; reflexive and auto-Jewish ethnographies; traditionalist and modernist communities; and communities spread widely through Europe, North America, North Africa and the Middle East.  "

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities.

Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo. Florentine painters and sculptors grappled with Michelangelo's enormous inventiveness.

We look to the development of these traditions through historical and cultural perspectives. The course then turns to the modern period, considering the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization upon religious ideologies and practices. The primary focus of the course will be the ethnographic study of contemporary religious practices in the region. We examine phenomena such as ritual, pilgrimage, possession, devotionalism, monasticism, asceticism, and revivalism through a series of ethnographic case studies. In so doing, we also seek to understand the impact of politics, modernity, diasporic movement, social inequality, changing gender roles, and mass mediation upon these traditions and practices"

With fresh eyes and surprising insights, it will take you beyond the fashionable fictions and clichés to look at the twenty-five years during which the United States, through six presidential administrations, was involved in Vietnamese affairs (1950-1975). For decades, Americans have been meditating on ""the lessons of the Vietnam War,"" but it turns out that neither was any lesson ever learned nor were the so-called ""lessons"" even plausibly related to actual events. Today, Americans continue to be taught myths about the Vietnam War. This course shows why these myths obstruct a realistic understanding of American history during the past half-century"

Over the course of the semester, our investigations will range from the ancient poems of the Man'yōshū, to the haiku of Issa and Bashō, to the emergence of modern free verse poetry, and finally contemporary poetry in the age of the internet. At the forefront will be how literature connects to other media, by looking at poems composed through audio, film, painting, video games, and the computer. To do so, we will be taking a hands-on approach: students will not only analyze the form and content of Japanese poetry throughout the ages, but will also engage in critical poetic production themselves, trying their hand at composing poems in a variety of modes akin to the works under consideration. All texts will be available in both English and Japanese; class discussion and all assignments will be in English. No prior knowledge of Japanese language, history, or culture required"

Across its long history, the question of how China's urban centers have been nested into larger networks of outlying rural areas, and how those outlying regions were or were not well integrated (politically, economically, culturally) with urban centers, has been of great concern to politicians, merchants, moral philosophers, artists, urban planners, and ideologues.  This course poses a single fundamental question: are there in fact two enduring Chinas, one urban and one rural, with vastly different cultures, economies, and social landscapes? Additionally, we will ask, what has over a century of industrialization and modernization done to the rural-urban divide and historical modes of rural-urban integration?  We will examine these questions from a wide array of sources, including historical and archaeological data, sociological and anthropological inquiry, and artistic and literary production.  We will also explore various critical approaches to analyzing and conceptualizing rural and urban life across these sources"

This year marks the 50th anniversary of this historic occupation. The April 19, 1969 incident known as ""the Willard Straight Takeover"" or ""Willard Straight Occupation"" occurred during Parents' Weekend when black students occupied the student union on campus and, when threatened, returned with firearms in self-defense and also advocated for an Africana center to be developed. This protest, which one of its most vocal critics has identified as a catalyst for the nation's ""culture wars,"" is one of the most important events in the history of Cornell University. Yet, even after fifty years have passed, this event remains misunderstood, and its facts are sometimes grossly distorted or exaggerated. Even worse, sometimes this history has been forgotten or else routinely omitted from major histories and timelines at Cornell. The main goal in developing this course is to make a scholarly framework available in which they might expand and reinforce their knowledge of this topic, while contributing to new research on it, for so many students are curious about this history. "

In this course, students will be learning about and seeing cutting-edge research in modern laboratories. Critically, they will see what the practice of science is like. The course will have three modules, each centered on the lab of a different Cornell faculty member. First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed.

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

While Locke likened the newborn's mind to a blank slate, Freud compared the mind to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems. More recently, many have endorsed Turing's proposal that the mind is a computer. Why is this idea attractive and what exactly is a computer? Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway? Could a machine ever count as a person and make choices based on its own free will? Is it really so clear that we have this kind of free will?"

The course first explores brain pathways for processing visual, auditory, body and face movements, and tactile stimuli that comprise the raw material used to judge the emotional significance of external events. Next, brain regions involved in the (1) emotional evaluation of that sensory input, and (2) emotional expression once a significant event is identified are described. Then, brain processes underlying the special nature of human emotional experience (subjective feelings) are explored. All of these basic emotional processes are extended by placing them within widespread brain networks that modulate emotional behavior. There is an emphasis on social contexts and the development of social emotions, including social bonding and social rejection.

If robots are simply, as the dictionary suggests, machines ""designed to function in the place of a living agent,"" then what is so disturbing about them? Since robots are designed to replace human labor (first economic, and now also emotional), do they represent a threat as much as they do an aid? What happens when robots exceed their purpose, and become more humanlike? How do robots read, write, and feel? How do the activities of coding and writing, or decoding and reading differ? Students will be equipped with the vocabulary and writing strategies to rigorously analyze, compare, and debate the meaning of robots in the human imagination from different epochs, countries, languages, and media. In doing so, they will write in a variety of registers about works such as the play R.U.R. by Karel Čapek, who invented the term ""robot"".

Furthermore, is it possible to connect our current global refugee crisis, or the popularity of the film Avatar (2009) to any previous and contemporary imperial formations? To answer these questions, one must not only address what makes these political entities similar or different, but also consider whether any theoretical proposition predicated solely on military and economic might would be adequate. In this FWS, the question of empire will be addressed through historical, theoretical, and representational perspectives by looking at films, music, and literary texts.

COML 1127,FWS: Cannibal Cultures,3,Graded,"Fall, Spring",,,,,,,"The cannibal is always the other. Eating human flesh as a practice or a ritual always happens in the remote past or in far-away places. And yet, the cannibal lives among us. In spite of real cases of cannibalism, most of these cannibals inhabit our reality only in books, films, songs, or artworks. Nevertheless, they form an important part of our cultural imaginary. This course investigates figures of the cannibal in contemporary aesthetic texts (and some of their influential predecessors) with a focus on different cultural contexts. Issues that will be at the center of our attention are cannibalism's deployment to mark cultural differences, as well as for political and ideological purposes, its relation to sensationalism and (spectatorial) pleasure, and its varying configurations in different cultural contexts and media. As we engage with a wide range of texts, from novels to television series, from films to video clips, from art to philosophical reflections, we will use them as models and inspirations for different writing exercises.            This course deals with cannibalism—explicitly violent content will be part of the class"

Along with the images we find in poems themselves, how do poetry and poets figure in fiction and film, in music and popular culture? How do such figures inform both the images we find in poems and poetry's own image? What is poetry's relation to other genres and discourses, to self and language, history and politics? Exploring such issues in verse and prose, in fiction, film, and other media, including among others Blake, Wordsworth, Keats, Dickinson, Poe, Baudelaire, Pound, Williams, Neruda, Parra, Bolaño, and Dylan, the course will arc toward impactful recent interventions by such contemporary intermedial artists as Lin-Manuel Miranda, Beyoncé, and Kendrick Lamar"

Although today many might think of Islamophobia or Judeophobia as unchangeable---fear of and hatred for Islam and Muslims or Judaism and Jews---these ideas and the social and political practices informed by them have varied greatly over time and place. They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet. We will investigate how these figures (the Muslim, the Jew) serve as a prism through which we can understand various social, political and cultural processes and the interests of those who produce and consume them"

What affinities, loves and thefts, and tensions are present in cultural forms such as anime, jazz, kung fu, and K-pop? Students will consider the intersections and overlap between African and Asian diasporic cultures in global cities such as New York, Chicago, Havana, Lahore, Kingston, and Hong Kong to ask the question: when did Africa and Asia first encounter each other? This will be contextualized through a political and historical lens of the formation of a proto-Global South in the early twentieth, Afro-futurism, women of color feminisms, and Third World solidarity and internationalism. Tackling issues of race, gender, sexuality, and resistance, this seminar also reckons with the intertwined legacies of the institutions of African enslavement and Asian indenture by reading the novels of Patricia Powell and the paintings of Kehinde Wiley, for instance.

This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, and Marx) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively. We also consider how these three writers have been fused into a single constellation, 'Marx-Nietzsche-Freud,' and how they have been interpreted by others, including L. Althusser, A. Badiou, A.

Methodological discussions of ""world"" literature hinge on it, and Renaissance culture is unthinkable apart from it. The Renaissance—defined in terms of transmission and reception of ancient texts—is itself, in a way, translation. Tied to philosophical and theo-political problems of origin and copy, Truth and falsehood, fidelity, heresy and betrayal (as the Italian maxim traduttore, traditore attests), translation raises questions of sameness and identity, originality, authority, property, sacredness and evil. The seminar explores these questions in texts from Luther, Cervantes and Montaigne, through Benjamin, Derrida and Agamben.

We will try especially to develop: (1) a general theory of ""visual ideology"" (the gender, social, racial, and class determinations on the production, consumption, and appropriation of visual artifacts under modern and postmodern conditions); and (2) contemporary theoretical practices that articulate these determinations.

In this course, we will go to the sources of what we have come to call English literature to understand how texts and literary cultures played a role in shaping society and fashioning subjects, and how they also gave voice to dissent and difference — from the oral epic tradition of Beowulf to the public playhouses of Shakespeare's England, and from the intimate lyrics of the metaphysical poets to the indigenous and colonial voices of North America. We'll also take time to dwell on signal texts that can teach us the craft of literary invention. As we range from the boggiest depths of folk legend to the ""light fantastic"" of lyrical meter, we'll be building a toolkit of the literary terms and techniques that are necessary for the interpretation and creation of literary works.

One assumption of the course is that there are other things to do with poems besides interpret them: reading aloud, writing imitations or parodies, memorizing, identifying poetic techniques, and creating anthologies of favorite poems. No previous study of poetry is presumed"
ENGL 2050,Contemporary World Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(GB),,"This course examines contemporary world literature from the second half of the twentieth century to the present. Our readings will range across genres (fiction, poetry, drama, and film) and include writers from multiple geographies—in addition to America and Britain, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. As we define the category ""world literature,"" we will explore innovations in aesthetics as well as historical developments that have influenced recent literary production. In particular, our readings will compel us to investigate how nationalism, religion, gender, race and socioeconomic status have impacted the formation of world literature and its bearings on social justice"
ENGL 2270,Shakespeare,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,PMA 2670,(LA-AS),(HB),,"This class aims to give students a good historical and critical grounding in Shakespeare's drama and its central place in Renaissance culture. We read ten plays covering the length of Shakespeare's career: comedies, history plays, tragedies, and romances, including The Merchant of Venice, Twelfth Night, The Tempest, Othello, King Lear, Richard II, Henry IV Part One, and Henry V. Our study will include attention to dramatic forms, Shakespeare's themes, and social and historical contexts, including early modern English theater history. The course combines lectures and hands-on work in weekly discussions focused on performance, close reading, and questions raised by the plays. We will also view some film adaptations of Shakespeare. The class counts toward the pre-1800 requirement for English majors"

ENGL 2410,The Gothic Imagination,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course will ask us to turn a critical eye toward the weird bodies at the center of Gothic fiction: monsters, vampires, ghosts, and…the human self. We'll read gothic fiction from its beginnings to some recent YA incarnations, pairing many of our literary readings with examples of the gothic in contemporary American pop culture. The novels, films, and critical texts we read will provide us with a conceptual foundation for recognizing how and why specific cultural moments have adapted Gothic aesthetics. By attending to the strangely constituted bodies at the gothic's core, we will think critically about why the genre's dark fascination with gender and racial uncertainty, political power, and the limits of literary and scientific authority continue to haunt us into the twenty-first century"
ENGL 2600,Introduction to Native American Literature,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AIIS 2600, AMST 2600",(LA-AS),,,"The production of North American Indigenous literatures began long before European colonization, and persists in a variety of printed, sung, carved, painted, written, spoken, and digital media. From oral traditions transmitted through memory and mnemonics to contemporary genres and media, Native North American authors offer Indigenous perspectives on social, political, and environmental experience, through deft artistry and place-specific aesthetics. Our attention will focus on the contexts from which particular Native American literatures emerge, the ethics to consider when entering Indigenous intellectual territory, and close attention to common themes and techniques that frequently appear in contemporary Native American literature. Readings will feature a range of novels, poetry, short fiction, graphic novel/comics, and film"
ENGL 2725,Philosophy and Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"What can I know? What ought I do? What may I hope for? The three fundamental questions Kant says philosophy aims to answer have also been traditionally asked by literature: What kinds of truths and knowledge of ourselves, others, and the world can literature offer us? Does literature help us act morally or foster faith that history bends towards justice? This course introduces students to how literature and philosophy work with and sometimes against each other in addressing these concerns through problems such as the construction of identity, passions and human community, body-mind interrelations, the nature of aesthetic experience. We will also examine the role of metaphors, narrative, and dialogue in philosophy. Authors include Plato, Sophocles, Hume, Sterne, Kant, Shelley, Nietzsche, Merleau-Ponty, Woolf, Adorno, Beckett"
ENGL 2780,Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"BSOC 2781, FGSS 2780, LGBT 2780",(LA-AS),,,"We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of ""the body"" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called ""gender,"" ""sexuality,"" and ""race""? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science"
ENGL 2785,Comic Books and Graphic Novels,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"POW! ZAP! DOOM! This is a class about how we can draw together, studying a medium that is based in the practice, in all senses, of ""drawing together."" We will read Pulitzer winning memoirs and NSFW gutter rubbish. We will trace the history of sequential art from about 1898 to the present, including caricature, pop art, and meme cultures, Wonder Woman and Wimmin's Comix, Archie and archives. Studying comics requires us to entangle disciplines and to make things: graphic design, marketing, media studies, law, education, and various illuminated cosmologies. What is this medium that teaches us to read the page anew, to speak in bubbles, to witness and play with apocalypse, to enjoy our suspension in the infinite, and to indulge in graphic sensations?"

ENGL 2910,It's All Chinese to Me,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AAS 2910, AMST 2910",(CA-AS),,,"In her memoir Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong Kingston identified a conundrum familiar to many US-born children of Chinese immigrants when she asked: ""What is Chinese tradition and what is the movies?"" What is ""Chinese tradition""? Does it mean the same thing to people in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or to Chinese diasporic communities in North America?  Does ""Chineseness"" change across time and space? While there will be occasion to discuss what ""Chineseness"" means in different Asian contexts, this course will focus primarily on how ideas of ""China"" and ""Chineseness"" have been historically constructed by, for, and in the West—particularly in the US. Course materials include readings on the concept of ""Chineseness,"" Chinese American literature and film, and historical studies of East/West relations"

ENGL 2951,Poetry's Image,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,COML 2251,(HA-AS),,,"Where do we get our images of poets, and of poetry? Along with the images we find in poems themselves, how do poetry and poets figure in fiction and film, in music and popular culture? How do such figures inform both the images we find in poems and poetry's own image? What is poetry's relation to other genres and discourses, to self and language, history and politics? Exploring such issues in verse and prose, in fiction, film, and other media, including among others Blake, Wordsworth, Keats, Dickinson, Poe, Baudelaire, Pound, Williams, Neruda, Parra, Bolaño, and Dylan, the course will arc toward impactful recent interventions by such contemporary intermedial artists as Lin-Manuel Miranda, Beyoncé, and Kendrick Lamar"

Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120. The class counts toward the pre-1800 requirement for English majors"
ENGL 3390,Jane Austen,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that students who have read Jane Austen must be in want of an opportunity to continue that delicious experience, and that those who have not read her novels should. This course explores Austen's characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems which resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen's importance in literary history as well as her continuing attraction in the twenty-first century.

It will study their rise to political power through an examination of the autobiographies of women from the Caribbean, the U.S., Africa and Brazil. Political figures such as Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, Shirley Chisholm, Benedita da Silva will serve as some of the primary sources of analysis and discussion.

ENGL 3615,"Gramophone, Radio, Podcast: Sound Recording as a Medium for Writing",4,Graded,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This class examines current aural technologies of writing:  podcasts, audiobooks, site-specific headphone theater. We will focus on the challenges and opportunities of the present—making our own recordings along the way—from the point of view of the technologies' long history. Authors have always written for the ear, but after 1877, when Thomas Alva Edison read ""Mary Had a Little Lamb"" into a gramophone horn, a new set of possibilities were born. What new kinds of writing were made possible by the gramophone disc, the microphone, long-range broadcasting, high fidelity, audiotape, multitrack recording, stereo, binaural, and quadraphonic mixing, headphones, the Walkman, digitality, streaming on-demand? What new audiences and forms of listening accompanied these new technologies? We will consider the meaning of each technology when it was avant-garde, from Edison to Gertrude Stein, from William S. Burroughs to the Last Poets, to the Radiolab, Serial, and Homecoming podcasts. This unique class will feature collaborations with Ithaca's Cherry Artspace and visiting artists-in-residence from The World According to Sound"
ENGL 3742,Africans and African Americans in Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 3732, ASRC 3742",(CA-AS),,,"When an African and an African American meet, solidarity is presumed, but often friction is the result. In this course, we will consider how Africans and African Americans see each other through literature. What happens when two peoples suffering from double consciousness meet? We will examine the influence of historical forces including slavery, colonialism and pan-Africanism on the way writers explore the meeting between Africans and African Americans. Specifically we will look at how writers such as W.E.B DuBois, Maya Angelou, NoViolet Bulawayo, Chimamanda Adichie, Richard Wright, Eugene Robinson, Philippe Wamba, Teju Cole, and Malcolm X have understood the meeting"
ENGL 3747,The Trouble with Crime Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Where would crime fiction be without its constitutive trouble—the body on the floor, the predatory femme fatale, the sin-steeped city that only an honest sleuth can purge? And where would literary culture be without crime fiction to make trouble for—to attack, parody, reinvent, complicate, and rejoice in? This course will review classic mystery story design in Poe, Doyle, and Hammett and will read later fictions by such writers as Jorge Luis Borges, Vladimir Nabokov, Patricia Highsmith, Michael Chabon, China Miéville, Tana French, and Mukoma Wa Ngugi, viewing films by John Huston, Roman Polanski, Christopher Nolan, and Denis Villeneuve—and promising never to let the trouble go away. and promising never to let the trouble go away"
ENGL 3790,Reading Nabokov,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 3815, RUSSL 3385",(LA-AS),,,"This course offers an exciting trip to the intricate world of Nabokov's fiction. After establishing himself in Europe as a distinguished Russian writer, Nabokov, at the outbreak of World War II, came to the United States where he reestablished himself, this time as an American writer of world renown. In our analysis of Nabokov's fictional universe, we shall focus on his Russian corpus of works, from Mary (1926) to The Enchanter (writ. 1939), all in English translation, and then shall examine the two widely read novels which he wrote in English in Ithaca while teaching literature at Cornell: Lolita (1955) and Pnin (1957)"

ENGL 3895,Reflecting on the Prison Classroom,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,GOVT 3192,(CA-AS),,,"This course offers students a chance to write and reflect intensively on their engagement inside Auburn, Cayuga, Elmira or Five Points Correctional Facilities. We will read essays by incarcerated writers and advocates for change to the criminal legal system, and fiction about prison experience. These readings will provoke our thinking about crime and punishment, confinement and ""rehabilitation"" and the project of higher education in correctional setting, and inspire our own writing about our motivations and discoveries as in-prison volunteers -- personal, social, educational, political, moral and spiritual"
ENGL 3920,Introduction to Critical Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 3541, GERST 3620, GOVT 3636",(LA-AS),,,"Shortly after the last election, The New Yorker published an article entitled ""The Frankfurt School Knew Trump was Coming."" This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, and Marx) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"
ENGL 3954,"Spoken Word, Hip-Hop Theater, and the Politics of the Performance",4,Graded,Fall,,,"AMST 3754, FGSS 3754, LGBT 3754, LSP 3754, PMA 3754",(LA-AS),,,"In this course, we will critically examine the production and performance of race, ethnicity, sexuality, and gender through literature and contemporary performance genres such as spoken word, slam poetry, and hip-hop theatre"
ENGL 4330,"Women, Real and Imagined: British Romanticism",4,Graded,Fall,,,FGSS 4331,(LA-AS),(HB),,"In this course we will trace how the wider participation of women in the public sphere affected media, gender roles, and sexuality in early nineteenth-century England. Women, as well as men, responded vigorously to the French Revolution and to the British reaction against it. Women were able, during the Romantic period, to accomplish widely contrasting achievements, such as these: follow up A Vindication of the Rights of Man with A Vindication of the Rights of Women; win fame and earn a living by writing Italian sonnets, or by writing closet dramas; win a separation payment after an affair with the Prince of Wales and then thrive as a writer and intellectual; and, of course—as Mary Shelley did, at age 19—write and publish Frankenstein. This seminar aims to understand, interpret, and even participate in the history of women's writing and achievements in the public sphere—as well as—also important—more private imaginative experiences. No previous knowledge of pre-twentieth century literature is necessary"
ENGL 4350,Make it New: Literary Uncertainty,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"A study of the impact of imaginative innovation in literary history—what triggers the creation of new literary genres; how is creativity shaped to convey new meanings; how does novelty enter into the literary tradition, to become convention? We will apply these questions to a varied selection of works, each of which plays a distinctive role in ""making it new"" in English literature. As we consider works from slave narrative to Gothic fiction, travel literature, the erotic novel, and manners fiction, we will define the distinctive incentives for innovation and consider common forms of novelty across a range of imaginative experiences. Texts include: Behn, Oroonoko; Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Richardson, Pamela; Fielding, Joseph Andrews; and Burney, Evelina. This course counts as a pre-1800 course for English majors"
ENGL 4470,Fictional Worlds in the Nineteenth-Century British Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Why are prequels and sequels snapped up so eagerly by today's audiences? Extending the story-line backwards or forwards allows us to gain new insights into characters we thought we knew. The same can happen with the fictional worlds that surround the characters. Some Victorian novels gain this sort of richness by themselves, without extending their stories backward or forward. We will read two such novels, Dickens's Little Dorrit and Eliot's Middlemarch. Both are quite long, but our course syllabus will give you time to enjoy them. Wuthering Heights joins them, reminding us that memorable fictional worlds can come in smaller packages. These three novels allow us to experience life in a city and a town, as well as in isolated houses on the English moors. They are among the greatest novels written in the Victorian era, or in any other"
ENGL 4509,Toni Morrison's Novels,4,Graded,Fall,,,"AMST 4519, ASRC 4509, ASRC 6513, ENGL 6513, FGSS 4509, FGSS 6513",(LA-AS),,,"Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison received her M.A. in English at Cornell University in 1955.  To study her, in a way, is to gain a deeper understanding of how she journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, and  how she has  shaped  Cornell's great legacy.  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the ""love trilogy"" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored"
ENGL 4525,Twentieth-Century Women Writers and Artists,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 4525,(LA-AS),,,"This course will explore a concern shared by contemporary women writers and artists. In their works, bodily visibility raises questions about sexuality, race, and mother-daughter relations. They also use fiction and visual culture to show ingestion and forced incorporation. For example, many works emphasize scenes of eating and, contrarily, refusing to eat. Texts may include novels by Dorothy Allison, Tsitsi Dangarembga, Edwidge Danticat, Oonya Kempadoo, Jamaica Kincaid, Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, Marilynne Robinson, and Leslie Marmon Silko. Artists examined may include Renee Cox, Mary Kelly, Shirin Neshat, Jolene Rickard, Cindy Sherman, Sally Mann, Bernie Searle, and Kara Walker"
ENGL 4645,"Culinary Literature, Literary Food",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,FGSS 4645,(LA-AS),,,"Why might a novelist choose to focus on food (or a chef) in order to tell a particular tale?  How do writers use the language of food to explore issues such as gender, sexuality, race and nation? What can a study of food tell us about the dynamic of power and its circulation in US culture? This class interrogates the ways food functions as a symbol in literary texts; we will also consider how writers deploy narrative form and language to capture the sensual pleasures of food. Our entrees will consist of novels and short stories, but sides may include memoir, food essays, and cookbooks"
ENGL 4733,The Future of Whiteness,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 4733, AMST 6733, ASRC 4733, ENGL 6733",(CA-AS),,,"How should anti-racist people respond to the new racialized white identities that have emerged recently in Europe and the United States? What alternative conceptions of whiteness are available? How can we form cross-racial progressive coalitions? How should we understand the nature of our social identities and what they make possible? This course is a wide-ranging introduction to these questions with readings drawn from social and cultural theory, as well as literature and film. Films include Get Out and I Am Not Your Negro, as well as such Hollywood classics as Imitation of Life. Texts by such writers as James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Danzy Senna and Dorothy Allison, as well as relevant anthropological and social-theoretical work (Strangers in Their Own Land, Whiteness of a Different Color) and memoirs of anti-racist activists. A central text will be the recent book The Future of Whiteness by the Latina feminist scholar Linda Martin Alcoff"
ENGL 4795,Quantification: Literature that Counts,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"How does literature count? Language and numbers seem to be radically divergent—if not mutually exclusive—ways of representing the human world. And yet throughout history examples abound of literary works that attempt to incorporate, approximate, or travesty (and often all at once!) quantitative methods of counting, permutation, and computation in the linguistic medium of fiction. Is literature always expressive? Is quantification always cold? What does it feel like to be a number? When we analyze literature quantitatively, what can we see with fresh eyes and what do we miss? This course will introduce students to the fundamentals of literary critical analysis, including the emergent quantitative and computational tools of the digital humanities. We will read diverse works of literature to ground our investigation"

Students will be introduced to foundational psychoanalysts: Sigmund Freud, Carl Jung, Melanie Klein, Frantz Fanon, Wilfred Bion, Jacques Lacan, Hortense Spillers, Christopher Bollas. We will also study literary portraits of madness, considering how these portraits correspond or diverge from psychoanalytic frameworks. We will discuss how to apply psychoanalytic theory to literature, but also how to challenge the theory with a literary lens. Through collective dialogue and private reading, we will think about the energy of own minds, our constitutions and possibilities and breaking points. These investigations will be both intellectual and intimate, both troubling and reparative. For longer description and instructor bio visit http://societyhumanities.as.cornell.edu/courses"
ENGL 4968,Zombies of the Anthropocene: Climate Change in the Cultural Imagination,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"SHUM 4638, SHUM 6638",,,,"From The Walking Dead to 28 Weeks Later, zombies are king. These monsters are more than pop culture fluff. This course considers how zombies serve as a symptom of and metaphor for anthropogenic climate change. Both phenomena challenge traditional humanistic assumptions about the division between the natural and unnatural world; the human and nonhuman; the spiritual and secular. As mass-scale climate disaster appears ever nearer, the zombie becomes less a fantasy, and more a heuristic for understanding our seemingly new and startlingly monstrous world. Drawing from novels, films, TV shows, comic books, anthropology, political theory, climate science, and governmental reports, this interdisciplinary course will ponder how zombies – and we, as planetary citizens - move, think, and feed.

The German tradition in particular is rich in literary texts that offer posthuman constellations and experiences avant la lettre. Other texts, which often show a significant German literary or philosophical influence, will also be included. In addition to analyzing specific historical contexts and developments that encouraged literary sorties beyond the limits of the human, we will closely examine literature as a privileged medium of such transgression"

ENGL 6110,Old English,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 3110, MEDVL 3110, MEDVL 6110",,,,"In this course, we will read and discuss some of the earliest surviving English poetry and prose. Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf.

ENGL 6225,What is Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"A myriad of texts bear witness to the emancipatory power of writing: the autobiography of Frederick Douglass and Virginia Woolf's A Room of One's Own, to name just two. This course will explore how scholars and theorists (Juliet Fleming, Chris Johnson, Greg Ulmer, Walter Ong, Bernard Stiegler, Catherine Malabou) have approached writing since Derrida first proposed the (impossible) science of grammatology and identified writing as a pharmakon. We will return to some of the texts that were key to post-structuralist theory, Plato's Phaedrus and Rousseau's Essay on the Origin of Languages; and we will also consider how media theory has inflected our approaches to writing. To keep after the question of what writing is (even if we cannot ever know its ends), we will also look to literary works that have tried to address that question; here, authors may include Christine de Pizan, Philip Sidney, Herman Melville, Franz Kafka, James Joyce, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Ishmael Reed. "
ENGL 6285,Early Modern Translations,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,COML 6285,,,,"Translation is a cultural, conceptual, and political problem. It lies at the heart of the literary itself. Methodological discussions of ""world"" literature hinge on it, and Renaissance culture is unthinkable apart from it. The Renaissance—defined in terms of transmission and reception of ancient texts—is itself, in a way, translation. Tied to philosophical and theo-political problems of origin and copy, Truth and falsehood, fidelity, heresy and betrayal (as the Italian maxim traduttore, traditore attests), translation raises questions of sameness and identity, originality, authority, property, sacredness and evil. The seminar explores these questions in texts from Luther, Cervantes and Montaigne, through Benjamin, Derrida and Agamben. Particular focus is on the early modern as template and groundwork for the complexity and centrality of translation to life"
ENGL 6513,Toni Morrison's Novels,4,Graded,Fall,,,"AMST 4519, ASRC 4509, ASRC 6513, ENGL 4509, FGSS 4509, FGSS 6513",,,,"Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison received her M.A. in English at Cornell University in 1955.  To study her, in a way, is to gain a deeper understanding of how she journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, and  how she has  shaped  Cornell's great legacy.  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the ""love trilogy"" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored"
ENGL 6631,American Poetry: 1950-2000,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 6631,,,,"This course will explore postwar US poetry through the lens of what might be called micro-periodization. Taking the decade as a privileged frame of reference, we'll ask what recognizable shifts in style, institutional placement, and cultural value occur as we move from the 50s to the 60s, 70s, 80s, and 90s. These temporal modulations will serve as an alternative to the spatial demarcations that have typically shaped accounts of postwar poetry—e.g., by region, school, movement, etc.  We'll consider, for example, how the loosely paratactic style that emerges in the 50s (Ginsberg, Lowell, Bishop) gives way in the 60s to a lyric mode that blends epiphany and epigram (Merwin, Wright, Creeley), yielding in turn to a more discursive style in the 70s (Ammons, Ashbery, Rich)"
ENGL 6635,Literature of the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"The works we will read this term imagine and embody a nation's survival when it faces war within its own boundaries. With a primary focus on poetry and novels, we will also look at photographs, political cartoons, recruitment posters, and trading cards—items that give a visual resonance to the iconography of national violence. Asking about gendered and racialized embodiments associated with the national project on both sides of the conflict, we will want to find out how gender, race, and nation are written into 19th-century North America"
ENGL 6731,Politics of English and African Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"Things Fall Apart has been translated into over 50 languages but has not yet been translated into Igbo, the author's mother tongue. Heart of Darkness would be a close equivalent if it had never been translated into Polish. How can it be that Africa's most famous book does not yet exist in Igbo? By looking at the growth and standardization of English first in England and then its implementation through colonial education in Africa, you will get a good grasp of the relationship between language, identity, and decolonization as a contradiction within the English metaphysical empire. We will therefore be exploring philological debates in Romantic England and post-colonial Africa"
ENGL 6733,The Future of Whiteness,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 4733, AMST 6733, ASRC 4733, ENGL 4733",,,,"How should anti-racist people respond to the new racialized white identities that have emerged recently in Europe and the United States?  What alternative conceptions of whiteness are available? How can we form cross-racial progressive coalitions? How should we understand the nature of our social identities and what they make possible?  This course is a wide-ranging introduction to these questions with readings drawn from social and cultural theory, as well as literature and film. Films include Get Out and I Am Not Your Negro, as well as such Hollywood classics as Imitation of Life. Texts by such writers as James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Danzy Senna and Dorothy Allison, as well as relevant anthropological and social-theoretical work (Strangers in Their Own Land, Whiteness of a Different Color) and memoirs of anti-racist activists.  A central text will be the recent book The Future of Whiteness by the Latina feminist scholar Linda Martin Alcoff"

Women, as well as men, responded vigorously to the French Revolution and to the British reaction against it. Women were able, during the Romantic period, to accomplish widely contrasting achievements, such as these: follow up A Vindication of the Rights of Man with A Vindication of the Rights of Women; win fame and earn a living by writing Italian sonnets, or by writing closet dramas; win a separation payment after an affair with the Prince of Wales and then thrive as a writer and intellectual; and, of course—as Mary Shelley did, at age 19—write and publish Frankenstein.

What can a study of food tell us about the dynamic of power and its circulation in US culture? This class interrogates the ways food functions as a symbol in literary texts; we will also consider how writers deploy narrative form and language to capture the sensual pleasures of food.

This senior seminar offers an interdisciplinary exploration of infectious diseases.  Our investigations take us from medieval Europe's ""Black Plague,"" to Tuberculosis in early twentieth century United States and its global resurgence at the turn of the twenty-first, to Ebola and its ongoing, periodic outbreaks today. We consider the consequences epidemics have for how we live and imagine shared ecological futures.  Examining work from the life sciences, social sciences, and arts & humanities, we explore the ways in which life and death, disease and survivability, health and thriving are shaped by infectious microbes, embodied eco-social forces, and contingent regimes of knowledge-power. "

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,"Fall, Spring",,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"

This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

We will begin with a review of popular approaches to studying policy and then move on to explore the various stages of policy development: agenda-setting, policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback and policy change. We will consider the roles played by both institutions (congress, the bureaucracy and interests groups) and everyday people. Finally, we will closely study several specific policy arenas (a few likely candidates include: education policy, health policy, social welfare policy and housing policy). As we engage all of these ideas, students will be consistently challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making in a democratic polity and to envision pathways for substantive political change.   "

The massive number of people imprisoned in the United States speaks volumes about our policy priorities and about our democracy. How did things get this way? How did we end up being the nation that incarcerates more of its population than virtually any other? What policy processes directly and indirectly account for this? What explains the change that we now appear to be experiencing? What is the future of the U.S. prison system? What is the future of our democracy?

We are told often that American primacy is in decline and that other powers are rising. What does this mean when we examine the experience of Government and Business in different countries around the world?  Is the international political economy a hydraulic system in which some units rise and others fall? Are the dynamics of the international political economy all pointing in one direction? Or are they marked by cross-currents?  This course seeks answers to these questions by teaching the basics of macro-economics, examining a range of powerful states (among others China, India, Russia and Japan) and persisting issues (financial globalization and foreign investment; oil and OPEC; trade and aid) as they play themselves out in different countries (such as Malaysia, Korea; Saudi Arabia, Nigeria; Mexico, Brazil, Uganda, Indonesia)"

This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, and Marx) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

While the politics of fear is on the rise worldwide, Israel has seen it long ago. Throughout its existence, Israel has grown strong, but its existential fears have not subsided. Israel, moreover, can teach us about the role of freedom and morality in politics. Israel's existential fears, alongside the realization of choice, has prompted Zionists to seek existential legitimation. In recent years, however, a growing frustration at attainting such legitimacy has fostered ""bad faith politics,"" substituting freedom with a sense of ""no choice."""

This makes it critical for informed citizens to understand the dynamics of armed conflict between states. What kinds of factors make war more or less likely? How do shifts in power – like the rise of China – affect the likelihood of war? What role do nuclear weapons – which China, Russia, and now North Korea have – play? How do the personal and psychological characteristics of leaders – like Donald Trump, Vladimir Putin, and Kim Jong Un – matter? What about domestic politics? Do political crises and polarization make war more or less likely? In this course, we will investigate all of these questions and more through a survey of relevant theoretical work by political scientists, an exploration of significant conflicts from modern history, and an application of these insights to contemporary conflict hot spots"

What distinguishes ethnic identity from other social identities, such as religious and ideological identities? When does ethnicity mature into ethnonationalism, and why and how does it propel conflict and political violence? What are the possible ways to prevent, manage, transform and resolve ethnic conflicts?

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively.

These forms of data are now extremely common in the social sciences. In the first three weeks we attain mastery of some of the more intricate Stata and R post-estimation procedures. These are essential for interpreting typical models of categories and counts, since in the typical application, effects on the mean of the dependent variable are not constant but vary with settings of the explanatory variables. We then proceed to the key application, the analysis of non-continuous dependent variables. Each student will be required to actively participate in a group presentation of the nuts and bolts of a data analysis using this kind of data, either assigned by the instructor or based off peer research.

The first is to deepen the understanding of antique thought and build upon prior study of canonical texts (Phaedrus, Republic, Nicomachean Ethics); the second is to introduce the work of contemporary continental thinkers (Agamben, Badiou, Caverero, Derrida, Irigaray, Kofman). These projects are interwoven ones. For, while continental thought (especially its contemporary avatars) have often elaborated their philosophic projects and concepts through a close reading of the ancients, graduate curricula have often kept them as separate objects of inquiry. At the same time, a new generation of N. American political theorists have built upon these continental philosophemes (khora, pharmakon, parrhesia; energeia) to open ancient texts to proximate political -theoretic issues such as immigration, translation, the interrelation of aesthetics and philosophy, matters of ""free"" democratic speech. This semester we will focus upon French and Italian thinkers and subject them to a double reading. To what extent are their philosophic projects unthinkable without the ancients? How might these ancient texts in turn both enable but also resist recuperation? How might both strands-contemporary and ancient- inform our present?"

What relevance might methodological disputes among historians (of political thought and of other things) have for theoretical engagement with the present? What light do the histories of academic institutions, of the disciplines, and of canon-formation shed on contemporary theoretical practice? This graduate seminar will consider these and related issues through an idiosyncratic and selective survey of important recent work in the field, chosen and supplemented with an eye toward the disclosure of its own historical contexts, and toward the critical evaluation of its investments in, stances toward, and, sometimes, disavowals of history"

This course views the field of Cognitive Neuroscience through the lens of Embodied Cognition research, and evaluates the extent to which ""embodiment"" may be passing fad, a useful shift in perspective, or a revolutionary new way of building theories about brain and mind. "

In this introductory survey to Caribbean history we will answer these and many other questions through the study of the political, economic, social, cultural, and environmental transformations of the Caribbean from the arrival of Columbus to the era of the Haitian Revolution. We will follow indigenous people, Spanish conquistadors, English, Dutch, and French pirates and privateers, planters, and merchants, imperial officers, slaves, sailors, and revolutionaries as they adapted to the multiple transformations that shaped this region. Through lectures, discussions, and readings of primary and secondary sources we will navigate the Caribbean in a quest to understand the historical processes that gave shape to this tropical paradise"

HIST 2082,Of Ice and Men: Masculinities in the Medieval North,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"FGSS 2082, MEDVL 2082",(HA-AS),(GHB),,"The Middle Ages are usually imagined as a time of manly men and feminine women: no room for gender ambiguity in Conan the Barbarian! Yet gender, then as now, was in fact unstable, multiple, and above all, constructed. This course explores the different ways masculinity was understood, manufactured, and manipulated in northern Europe – primarily early Ireland, England, and Scandinavia – using a variety of literary, legal, historical, archaeological, and artistic sources. Students will gain new perspectives on both gender and sex, on the one hand, and the history of medieval Europe, on the other"
HIST 2157,Tolstoy: History and Counter-Culture,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"RELST 2157, RUSSL 2157",(HA-AS),,,"Tolstoy is impossible. An aristocrat who renounced his wealth. A man of titanic appetites who repeatedly swore off meat, alcohol and sex. A Christian who didn't believe in God. An anarchist who ruled his own estate like an ancient patriarch. A writer of genius who thought literature was evil and a waste of time and referred to his greatest book as ""garbage."" An inexhaustible skeptic who wanted nothing but mere faith. In Tolstoy's imaginative universe, we may find the origin of many modern contradictions and anxieties, about money, about sec and about power. But Tolstoy's modern consciousness was not created in Paris or New York. Tolstoy was made in late imperial Russia - notoriously, the least modern country in nineteenth-century Europe. How, then, did Tolstoy happen? How can we account historically for his epic project of self-fashioning? In this seminar, we will see Tolstoy at work in the creation of an heroic counter-cultural persona, writing against the social and political currents of his own time"
HIST 2165,The Death of Democracy: Europe Between the World Wars,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(HA-AS),,,"What is democracy? What does it need to thrive? When does it die? How do anti-liberal, authoritarian regimes emerge? What makes them tick?  In 1921, a British liberal announced that democracy had already been accepted as the normal and natural form of government. World War I had delivered Europe's old monarchies and autocracies a fatal blow. Three massive continental empires had fallen apart, making way to parliamentary democracies everywhere from Germany to Poland and the Balkans. Yet by the 1930s, few of these democracies were still standing. In the east, a new political experiment had culminated in the rise of a Soviet Empire. In Germany, the democratic elections of 1933 enabled Hitler's rise to power and the growth of a regime unlike anything anyone had ever seen before. In Italy, Mussolini stamped parliamentary democracy under his foot, proclaiming the victory of totalitarianism. A variety of authoritarian regimes arose in between these extremes. They formed alliances and battled each other: at first in the Spanish Civil War and then in World War II. In this seminar, we will closely examine the rise and fall of democracies and anti-democratic regimes in Europe between the two world wars, in order to understand how democracy and authoritarianism are related and what kinds of challenges democracies have faced - both in the past and at present"

HIST 2315,The Occupation of Japan,4,Graded,Fall,,,"AMST 2315, ASIAN 2258",(HA-AS),(GB),,"In August 1945, Japan was a devastated country – its cities burned, its people starving, its military and government in surrender.  World War II was over.  The occupation had begun.  What sort of society emerged from the cooperation and conflict between occupiers and occupied?  Students will examine sources ranging from declassified government documents to excerpts from diaries and bawdy fiction, alongside major scholarly studies, to find out.  The first half of the course focuses on key issues in Japanese history, like the fate of the emperor, constitutional revision, and the emancipation of women.  The second half zooms out for a wider perspective, for the occupation of Japan was never merely a local event.  It was the collapse of Japanese empire and the rise of American empire in Asia.  It was decolonization in Korea and the start of the Cold War.  Students will further investigate these links in final individual research projects. "
HIST 2530,Introduction to Islamic Civilization,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"MEDVL 2655, NES 2655, RELST 2655",(HA-AS),(GHB),,"At the beginning of the 7th century, a new religion, Islam, appeared in Arabia and by the end of the century, Muslims had defeated the Byzantines and Persians and created an empire that stretched from Spain to India. For the next millennium, Islam glittered. Its caliphs, courts, and capitals were grander, more powerful, and more sophisticated than those of any medieval king, duke or prince. In this course, we will trace the emergence and development of Islamic civilization from the birth of Muhammad ca. 570 to the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. We will read the Qur'an and listen to its recitation; examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad; follow the course of the Arab conquests; explore the nature of the conflict between Sunnis and Shi'is; learn about the five pillars of Islam, sharia law, theology, and Sufism; and assess the achievements of Muslim intellectuals in literature, art, architecture, science, and philosophy"
HIST 2543,In the Crossfire of Empires: Africa and World War II,4,Graded,Fall,,,ASRC 2543,(HA-AS),,,"World War II was one of the most transformative periods in the history of the 20th century. As a result, scholars, writers and filmmakers continue to re-examine the war from multiple angles. Nonetheless, most accounts of the war marginalize Africa's role and the consequences of the war for African communities.   This course considers the new historiography on World War II that aims to put the 'world' back into our analysis of WW II and considers the ways in which imperialism, race and gender shaped the prosecution and the consequences of the war.  It focuses specifically on Africa's social, economic and political engagement with the powers at the center of the conflict and introduces students to emerging debates in African historiography and the historiography of World War II. "

This course explores many of the key themes of this critical period of American history: the rise of colonial opposition to Great Britain, the nature of the Revolutionary Wars, and the domestic ""republican experiment"" that followed the Treaty of Paris in 1783. The course emphasizes student interpretations with an eye toward analyzing the comparative experiences of women and men, ""everyday people"" and famous leaders, Native Americans, African-Americans, and those who opposed the Revolution"

This course offers a survey of the Mughal empire between c. 1500 and 1800, exploring how Mughal imperial culture reflected the cultural and religious diversity of India. We will consider how the rise and fall of the Mughals was connected to broader global transformations in early modern world, and how the rise of British power in India was shaped by the legacies of Mughal rule. Primary sources include court chronicles, biographies of emperors, as well as Mughal painting and architecture"

Students will build skills in historical interpretation and archival research and explore possibilities and challenges in preserving and presenting the past in a variety of public contexts—monuments, memorials, museums, historical sites, movies and television, and community-based history projects. For their final project, students will conduct original research in a digital or material archive, chosen in consultation with the instructor, to produce a draft of an exhibit, providing popularly accessible historical context and interpretation"
HIST 2851,Sex and Power in Jewish History,4,Graded,Fall,,,"JWST 2851, RELST 2851",(HA-AS),,,"Jewish men and women in early modern Europe lived their lives within a gendered social order inherited from the Talmudic period. The relationship between sex and power remained fundamental to Jewish communal discipline until the eighteenth century. The explosion of vernacular publishing, increasing economic and geographic mobility and the coming of emancipation challenged existing gender norms and liberated Jewish desire - well, almost. As we will see, modernity has an ambiguous effect on Jewish sexual expression and Jewish sexual politics. It is not clear that the emancipation of Jewish men had the same emancipatory effect on Jewish women. Jewish patriarchy proved unexpectedly resilient. In this course, we will explore why - despite Judaism's reputation for liberal attitudes to sex - neither most Jewish men nor many Jewish women embraced the possibilities of personal liberation from a reproductive regime of rigid self-control and near compulsory heterosexual monogamy"

During this momentous era, when European monarchies were successfully challenged and constitutional governments created, Blacks fomented their own American revolutions both in the outside of evolving ""New World democracies."" This course examines the black trajectory in British North America, Latin America, the French (especially Haiti,) the British and the Spanish Caribbean. The course begins with black participation in the U.S. independence War (1776-1781) and concludes with black (non-U.S.) participation in the independence wars against Spain. The course will also briefly address post-emancipation race relations in these American countries. "
HIST 3312,What was the Vietnam War?,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ASIAN 3312,(HA-AS),(GB),,"If you have ever wondered what the Vietnam War was all about, how did it begin, how was it fought, why was it so controversial, why did the American people turn against it, why was it important, why were generations of American students taught the North Vietnamese version of the war, why the South Vietnamese allies of the United States were abandoned, and what happened to the Vietnamese and the Americans as a result of the war—then this class is for you! With fresh eyes and surprising insights, it will take you beyond the fashionable fictions and clichés to look at the twenty-five years during which the United States, through six presidential administrations, was involved in Vietnamese affairs (1950-1975). For decades, Americans have been meditating on ""the lessons of the Vietnam War,"" but it turns out that neither was any lesson ever learned nor were the so-called ""lessons"" even plausibly related to actual events. Today, Americans continue to be taught myths about the Vietnam War. This course shows why these myths obstruct a realistic understanding of American history during the past half-century"

We will then follow the cause of freedom through the greatest slave rebellion in American history, and the attempts by formerly enslaved people to make freedom real in Reconstruction. And we will see how Reconstruction's tragic ending left questions open that are still not answered in U.S. society and politics"

This course brings together the history of capitalism with the political history of democracy. Its first aim is to show how the ongoing material and technical integration of the globe is both an enabling condition of mass democracy and a constraint on it. The second goal is to show how empires, nation-states, and international institutions have managed the tension between global economic integration and local political autonomy in different ways. We will discuss a series of key moments in the history of global capitalism in relation to transformations and crises of democracy, beginning in the era of High Imperialism in the 1870s-1880s; then moving to the populism of the 1890s; the interwar crisis of democracy beginning with World War I in 1914 through to the Great Depression and World War II; the post-WWII years, ending in the stagflation and oil crises of the 1970s; and the last four decades of economic globalization, from the debt crisis of the 1980s to the shocks of the 1990s and 2000s which form the precursor to the current turmoil. A second line of inquiry is to get a better grip on the analytical traditions that have grappled with and responded to these recurring crises, from different Marxist approaches and world systems theory to Polanyian political economy, neoliberalism, new institutional economics, Keynesianism, macro-finance and Minsky, and a variety of sociological paradigms from Weber and Habermas to Wolfgang Streeck and Ulrich Beck"

Reports from large-scale investigations called truth commissions, first-person testimonies, fiction, and films underscore the employment of technology in these conflicts—electrical torture, the destruction of electrical towers, foreign-made weapons and vehicles, and seizures of media stations and newspapers.

Although today many might think of Islamophobia or Judeophobia as unchangeable---fear of and hatred for Islam and Muslims or Judaism and Jews---these ideas and the social and political practices informed by them have varied greatly over time and place. They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet. We will investigate how these figures (the Muslim, the Jew) serve as a prism through which we can understand various social, political and cultural processes and the interests of those who produce and consume them"

For most of its existence it has also been a national capital or major provincial center for the many states and empires which vied for control of the vital land bridge connecting Africa, Europe and Asia. Thus many of the pivotal events which shaped western civilization were played out in the streets and structures of Jerusalem. This class will explore the history, archaeology, natural topography and role of Jerusalem throughout its long life, from its earliest remains in the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000 B.C.E.) to the 19th century, including Jebusite Jerusalem, Jerusalem as the capital of the Davidic dynasty, the Roman era city of Herod and Jesus, the Crusaders and medieval Jerusalem, and Ottoman Jerusalem as the city entered the modern era. Students will examine the original historical sources (e.g. the Bible, Josephus, the Madeba map, etc.) which pertain to Jerusalem. PowerPoint lectures will be used to illustrate the natural features, man-made monuments, and artifacts which flesh out the textual material, providing a fuller image of the world's most prominent spiritual and secular capital"

The relationship between sex and power remained fundamental to Jewish communal discipline until the eighteenth century. The explosion of vernacular publishing, increasing economic and geographic mobility and the coming of emancipation challenged existing gender norms and liberated Jewish desire - well, almost. As we will see, modernity has an ambiguous effect on Jewish sexual expression and Jewish sexual politics. It is not clear that the emancipation of Jewish men had the same emancipatory effect on Jewish women. Jewish patriarchy proved unexpectedly resilient. In this course, we will explore why - despite Judaism's reputation for liberal attitudes to sex - neither most Jewish men nor many Jewish women embraced the possibilities of personal liberation from a reproductive regime of rigid self-control and near compulsory heterosexual monogamy"

In this course we will learn how existential fears and anxieties shape our politics, partly through moral meaning-making. While the politics of fear is on the rise worldwide, Israel has seen it long ago. Throughout its existence, Israel has grown strong, but its existential fears have not subsided. Israel, moreover, can teach us about the role of freedom and morality in politics. Israel's existential fears, alongside the realization of choice, has prompted Zionists to seek existential legitimation. In recent years, however, a growing frustration at attainting such legitimacy has fostered ""bad faith politics,"" substituting freedom with a sense of ""no choice."""

What distinguishes ethnic identity from other social identities, such as religious and ideological identities? When does ethnicity mature into ethnonationalism, and why and how does it propel conflict and political violence? What are the possible ways to prevent, manage, transform and resolve ethnic conflicts? We shall address these and related questions drawing on key insights from various disciplines, focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, probing the resonance and dissonance of key theoretical arguments with the reality of that clash and of comparative conflicts"

The topic assumes primary importance because from the twentieth century onwards the statutes that include prohibitions have been multiplied, for instance to protect collective values, the environment, health, and so on. Faced with the flourishing of this kind of legislation, appropriate remedies must be applied.

Each week students will have read, and will actively discuss, several assigned texts. All class sessions will be led by the two instructors, but we hope during some weeks to bring in distinguished guest speakers as well, ideally including one or two Nobel Laureates"

LAW 7440,Law and Social Change: Comparative Law in Africa,3-4,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"This seminar is designed for students interested in a comparative study of law in Africa. The seminar will include an introduction to multiple African legal systems, as well as African customary law, constitutional law, labor law, property law and family law. The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches"

In evaluating these topics, the seminar will discuss the allocation of decision-making authority among the three branches of government; the balance between security and liberty and security and transparency; and it will consider possible ways to reconcile domestic law and policy objectives with international obligations and norms. It will focus on domestic sources of law—the Constitution, National Security Act, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, among others—but also will touch upon and consider the impact of international legal frameworks such as the UN Charter and Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols. [Please note: Students enrolled in LAW 7589 will be expected to have read, and to come to the first seminar session prepared to discuss, The Terror Presidency by Jack Goldsmith. This short and very readable book provides an excellent backdrop for the course, and any students joining LAW 7589 during the drop/add period are expected to read it ASAP; however, such students will be able to catch up with the rest of the class and therefore will not be disadvantaged.]"

LAW 7771,The Supreme Court and Tax Law,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"In this class we will read and discuss about 30 tax cases decided by the United States Supreme Court over the last 100 years. The goal of the course is to give students a reasonable familiarity with the structure of the U.S. tax law and important tax policy themes, as well as a number of technical tax issues that businesses and individuals are required to confront. This method of proceeding departs significantly from the more usual approach of introductory (and other) tax courses which involves studying the Internal Revenue Code, regulations, court cases and IRS rulings they relate to the taxation of corporations, partnerships, international transactions, and so on. Instead, the course will seek to expose the principal themes of U.S. tax law by examining a number of important controversies that have arisen in the tax law, and their resolution as analyzed in the Supreme Court opinions. The totality of the case readings and discussion hopefully will allow students to obtain a general but broad-based understanding of U.S. tax law – and in the course of doing that we'll hopefully generate some good discussions regarding several unanswered questions in the tax law! As well, the course's emphasis on judicial opinions may provide insight for anyone wishing to gain a better appreciation of how judges evaluate complex problems"

These briefs will not only entail serious legal analysis, but may also require sociocultural and political research, so that the students can effectively write about the conditions of the client's home country. Students will interview clients over the phone during this time, with the possibility of face-to-face interviews. Some clients may be incarcerated, and many will be out-of-state. Students may also locate expert and other witnesses, and draft affidavits and motions.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory. Finally, the course concludes by analyzing the relationship between the study of Islam, gender, and empire"

What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science"

Yet while we negotiate routinely, many of us know very little about the strategy and psychology of effective negotiations. Why do we sometimes get our way while other times we walk away feeling frustrated by our inability to achieve the agreement we desire? Negotiation is the art and science of securing an agreement between two or more interdependent parties. A person without a developed understanding of the social psychology and economics of effective negotiations cannot be an effective leader. We will discuss theories and principles to guide our negotiations (the science), and students will develop and sharpen their bargaining skills by actually negotiating with other students in experiential exercises (the art). Further, given that negotiations occur in so many aspects of life, your experience in this course should not only develop your professional skills but also facilitate your effectiveness in other life domains. The learning method is experiential. The course introduces a real-world toolkit for a strategic approach from pre-negotiation planning to post-negotiation evaluation.

The course will enable students to make informed business management decisions that are affected by an understanding of the technology enabling new business capabilities. The emphasis throughout the course is on the understanding of how cloud computing technology is affecting the marketplace and consumer behavior.  Secondary emphasis will be on how organizations can use these new technologies to their advantage, either through new product/service offerings or new organizational capabilities.  The course is designed to learn managerial consumption of large data sets and understand how those results were produced in order to make data-driven decisions.  We will discuss a framework for developing a data set, analyzing it, and generating meaningful insights. This framework will allow students to identify the opportunities, as well as perils that arise from the tsunami of data being produced. A hands-on exercise will further enhance these learnings to understand how large data sets can be used to gain business insights and not just taken as another reference point more commonly associated with traditional data analysis. Industry guest speakers will be an integral part of the course to present current and real-world scenarios given the recentness of the technologies and the rapid pace of market disruption they cause.    "

Although today many might think of Islamophobia or Judeophobia as unchangeable---fear of and hatred for Islam and Muslims or Judaism and Jews---these ideas and the social and political practices informed by them have varied greatly over time and place. They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet.

For the next millennium, Islam glittered. Its caliphs, courts, and capitals were grander, more powerful, and more sophisticated than those of any medieval king, duke or prince. In this course, we will trace the emergence and development of Islamic civilization from the birth of Muhammad ca. 570 to the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. We will read the Qur'an and listen to its recitation; examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad; follow the course of the Arab conquests; explore the nature of the conflict between Sunnis and Shi'is; learn about the five pillars of Islam, sharia law, theology, and Sufism; and assess the achievements of Muslim intellectuals in literature, art, architecture, science, and philosophy"

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory.

In this course we will learn how existential fears and anxieties shape our politics, partly through moral meaning-making. While the politics of fear is on the rise worldwide, Israel has seen it long ago. Throughout its existence, Israel has grown strong, but its existential fears have not subsided. Israel, moreover, can teach us about the role of freedom and morality in politics. Israel's existential fears, alongside the realization of choice, has prompted Zionists to seek existential legitimation. In recent years, however, a growing frustration at attainting such legitimacy has fostered ""bad faith politics,"" substituting freedom with a sense of ""no choice."""

What distinguishes ethnic identity from other social identities, such as religious and ideological identities? When does ethnicity mature into ethnonationalism, and why and how does it propel conflict and political violence?

While participant observation remains the cornerstone of ethnography, literary, archival, and other written works are increasingly being utilized as primary sources within the anthropological project. This course will hence offer an overview of anthropological works that trace the intersections between cultural production and the literary imagination. Rather than consider the literary elements of ethnography itself, we will strive to understand the disparate forms of social phenomena—both knowledge and practices—that arise from texts and textual practices specifically. Examples include analyses of literary cultures, media forms and non-traditional textual sources, bureaucratic structures, the use of archives, and more. Particular attention will be paid to works based in the Middle East and the Islamic world.

In addition to reading saints lives and the stories of hermits, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria.

While participant observation remains the cornerstone of ethnography, literary, archival, and other written works are increasingly being utilized as primary sources within the anthropological project.  This course will hence offer an overview of anthropological works that trace the intersections between cultural production and the literary imagination. Rather than consider the literary elements of ethnography itself, we will strive to understand the disparate forms of social phenomena—both knowledge and practices—that arise from texts and textual practices specifically. Examples include analyses of literary cultures, media forms and non-traditional textual sources, bureaucratic structures, the use of archives, and more. Particular attention will be paid to works based in the Middle East and the Islamic world.

Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway?

A writer of genius who thought literature was evil and a waste of time and referred to his greatest book as ""garbage."" An inexhaustible skeptic who wanted nothing but mere faith. In Tolstoy's imaginative universe, we may find the origin of many modern contradictions and anxieties, about money, about sec and about power. But Tolstoy's modern consciousness was not created in Paris or New York. Tolstoy was made in late imperial Russia - notoriously, the least modern country in nineteenth-century Europe. How, then, did Tolstoy happen? How can we account historically for his epic project of self-fashioning? In this seminar, we will see Tolstoy at work in the creation of an heroic counter-cultural persona, writing against the social and political currents of his own time"

Although today many might think of Islamophobia or Judeophobia as unchangeable---fear of and hatred for Islam and Muslims or Judaism and Jews---these ideas and the social and political practices informed by them have varied greatly over time and place. They even intersected during the Middle Age and in Ottoman times when ""the Jew"" was frequently represented as allied with ""The Muslim"". The first part of this course traces the history, trajectory, and political agency of Judeophobia and Islamophobia in texts and other forms of culture from late antiquity through the present. The second part of the course is devoted to modernity and the present especially in Europe and the United States focusing on representational practices---how Muslims/Islam and Jews/Judaism are portrayed in various discourses including the media, film and on the internet.

In this course, we will trace the emergence and development of Islamic civilization from the birth of Muhammad ca. 570 to the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. We will read the Qur'an and listen to its recitation; examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad; follow the course of the Arab conquests; explore the nature of the conflict between Sunnis and Shi'is; learn about the five pillars of Islam, sharia law, theology, and Sufism; and assess the achievements of Muslim intellectuals in literature, art, architecture, science, and philosophy"

Thus many of the pivotal events which shaped western civilization were played out in the streets and structures of Jerusalem. This class will explore the history, archaeology, natural topography and role of Jerusalem throughout its long life, from its earliest remains in the Chalcolithic period (ca. 4000 B.C.E.) to the 19th century, including Jebusite Jerusalem, Jerusalem as the capital of the Davidic dynasty, the Roman era city of Herod and Jesus, the Crusaders and medieval Jerusalem, and Ottoman Jerusalem as the city entered the modern era. Students will examine the original historical sources (e.g. the Bible, Josephus, the Madeba map, etc.) which pertain to Jerusalem.

Through a close examination of ethnographies, intellectual histories, and religious treatises, we will analyze the key debates and discourses surrounding the intersection of gender and Islam. We begin by investigating Quranic revelations and hadith concerning gender and sexual ethics, female figures of emulation in early Islam, and feminist exegeses of the Quran. Continuing onward, we focus upon the everyday lives of Muslim women and non-binary individuals in medieval, colonial, and post-colonial contexts, highlighting the ways in which people negotiate and respond to the sexual politics of the times in which they live as we ask what, if anything, is specifically ""Islamic"" about the situations under discussion? Following this, we embark upon a history of sexuality within Islam, tracing the ways in which the categories of ""homosexuality"" and ""heterosexuality"" came to exist in the Muslim world, as well as the history and positionality of trans communities past and present. We then continue with an exploration of Islamic feminism as it exists today, looking to the ways in which Muslim feminists have critically engaged both religious texts as well as Western feminist theory. Finally, the course concludes by analyzing the relationship between the study of Islam, gender, and empire"
RELST 2851,Sex and Power in Jewish History,4,Graded,Fall,,,"HIST 2851, JWST 2851",(HA-AS),,,"Jewish men and women in early modern Europe lived their lives within a gendered social order inherited from the Talmudic period. The relationship between sex and power remained fundamental to Jewish communal discipline until the eighteenth century. The explosion of vernacular publishing, increasing economic and geographic mobility and the coming of emancipation challenged existing gender norms and liberated Jewish desire - well, almost. As we will see, modernity has an ambiguous effect on Jewish sexual expression and Jewish sexual politics. It is not clear that the emancipation of Jewish men had the same emancipatory effect on Jewish women. Jewish patriarchy proved unexpectedly resilient. In this course, we will explore why - despite Judaism's reputation for liberal attitudes to sex - neither most Jewish men nor many Jewish women embraced the possibilities of personal liberation from a reproductive regime of rigid self-control and near compulsory heterosexual monogamy"

RELST 3738,Identity in the Ancient World,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ARKEO 3738, CLASS 3738",(CA-AS),(HB),,"Have you ever been asked 'who are you' or 'which group do you belong to'? You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

This seminar treats these questions by focusing on the desert, both imagined and real, as it has shaped religious ascetic practice, especially the development of Christian monasticism in the Middle East.  We will read widely from monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the ""desert."" In addition to reading saints lives and the stories of hermits, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about ""wilderness"" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures"

A writer of genius who thought literature was evil and a waste of time and referred to his greatest book as ""garbage."" An inexhaustible skeptic who wanted nothing but mere faith. In Tolstoy's imaginative universe, we may find the origin of many modern contradictions and anxieties, about money, about sec and about power. But Tolstoy's modern consciousness was not created in Paris or New York. Tolstoy was made in late imperial Russia - notoriously, the least modern country in nineteenth-century Europe. How, then, did Tolstoy happen? How can we account historically for his epic project of self-fashioning?

These monsters are more than pop culture fluff. This course considers how zombies serve as a symptom of and metaphor for anthropogenic climate change. Both phenomena challenge traditional humanistic assumptions about the division between the natural and unnatural world; the human and nonhuman; the spiritual and secular. As mass-scale climate disaster appears ever nearer, the zombie becomes less a fantasy, and more a heuristic for understanding our seemingly new and startlingly monstrous world. Drawing from novels, films, TV shows, comic books, anthropology, political theory, climate science, and governmental reports, this interdisciplinary course will ponder how zombies – and we, as planetary citizens - move, think, and feed.

This seminar centers on two intersecting areas of inquiry. The first deals with the nature of global movements: how people, ideas, arts, and capital move through world. Engaging postcolonial theory and scholarship on contemporary migration and transnationalism, we will interrogate the idea of borders and nations as well as those categories—like diaspora—that surpass or circumvent them. The second addresses how and why we might study these processes ethnographically. Here we will consider the potential and limitations of multi-sited and global ethnography, and question the possibility of an activist ethnography of global interconnection.

SHUM 6308,Expanded Practice Seminar,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ARCH 6308, COML 6369",,,,"Expanded Practice Seminars bring students and faculty in the humanities and the design disciplines together around a common and pressing urban issue such as the cultural and material practices induced by national or ethnic divisions; the increasingly leaky taxonomy of the terra firma in areas where land/water boundaries are rapidly changing; and the inadequacy of static zoning models that fail to capture dynamic, urban economics and performance. The intent of the Expanded Practice Seminar is to study complex urban conditions using theoretical and analytic tools derived in equal part from the design disciplines and humanist studies. The Expanded Practice Seminar includes a site visit to experience the conditions under study and meet with local experts, designers, and authorities.  Expanded Practice Seminars are offered under the auspices of Cornell University's Andrew W.

These monsters are more than pop culture fluff. This course considers how zombies serve as a symptom of and metaphor for anthropogenic climate change. Both phenomena challenge traditional humanistic assumptions about the division between the natural and unnatural world; the human and nonhuman; the spiritual and secular. As mass-scale climate disaster appears ever nearer, the zombie becomes less a fantasy, and more a heuristic for understanding our seemingly new and startlingly monstrous world. Drawing from novels, films, TV shows, comic books, anthropology, political theory, climate science, and governmental reports, this interdisciplinary course will ponder how zombies – and we, as planetary citizens - move, think, and feed.

This seminar centers on two intersecting areas of inquiry. The first deals with the nature of global movements: how people, ideas, arts, and capital move through world. Engaging postcolonial theory and scholarship on contemporary migration and transnationalism, we will interrogate the idea of borders and nations as well as those categories—like diaspora—that surpass or circumvent them. The second addresses how and why we might study these processes ethnographically. Here we will consider the potential and limitations of multi-sited and global ethnography, and question the possibility of an activist ethnography of global interconnection.

STS 4751,"Science, Race, and Colonialism",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,HIST 4751,(HA-AS),,,"This course is divided into three major thematic sections. The first looks at the history of racial thinking in the West. We begin with the existence (or not) of conceptions of biological race in the early- modern period, focusing on early voyages of discovery and so-called ""first encounters"" between the peoples of the Old and New Worlds.  In the second part of the course we will look at early enunciations of racial thought in the late 18th century and at the problems of classification that these raised, before examining the roots of ""Scientific Racism."" We close with a look at Darwin, Social Darwinism, and eugenics movements in different national contexts.  The last third of the course looks at science and technology in colonial contexts, including ""colonial technologies"" (guns, steam- ships, and telegraphs) as well as medicine and public hygiene"

How and why does epidemic unfold? This senior seminar offers an interdisciplinary exploration of infectious diseases.  Our investigations take us from medieval Europe's ""Black Plague,"" to Tuberculosis in early twentieth century United States and its global resurgence at the turn of the twenty-first, to Ebola and its ongoing, periodic outbreaks today. We consider the consequences epidemics have for how we live and imagine shared ecological futures.  Examining work from the life sciences, social sciences, and arts & humanities, we explore the ways in which life and death, disease and survivability, health and thriving are shaped by infectious microbes, embodied eco-social forces, and contingent regimes of knowledge-power. "

STS 6321,Inside Technology,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,SOC 6320,,,,"Rather than analyze the social impact of technology upon society, this course investigates how society gets inside technology. In other words, is it possible that the very design of technologies embody assumptions about the nature of society? And, if so, are alternative technologies, which embody different assumptions about society, possible? Do engineers have implicit theories about society? Is technology gendered? How can we understand the interaction of society and technology? Throughout the course the arguments are illustrated by detailed examinations of particular technologies, such as the ballistic missile, the bicycle, the electric car, and the refrigerator"
