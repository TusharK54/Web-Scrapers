Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting.

These questions and more will direct our inquiry into how Indigenous poets represent and strategically re-invent Euro-American literary forms to revitalize Indigenous aesthetic traditions and register resistance to oppression. We'll read numerous Indigenous poetic voices from across the continent, and see how they range from caustic criticism of EuroAmerican values, celebrate Indigenous relationships to place, and reject the role of victim or subjugation through trickster play and humor"

Critical interpretation of primary source material will be emphasized in the course, as will the development of students' ability to reflect critically on these documents, taking into account the perspective of both the colonizers and the colonized. "

Prominent themes will include forms of subversion, from military muscle to economic coercion, and how and why they have changed over time; meanings of liberty, democracy, freedom, and sovereignty in different places and times; popular responses to policies and actions of foreign administrations; the relationships between sovereign states and transnational corporations; the uses and abuses of History in the formulation and justification of policy initiatives and in local responses to them; and the complexities involved in discerning internal and external forces in an increasingly transnational world"

Prophetic Christianity and church formation became primary political weapons after enslavement, particularly in the Age of Jim Crow, and foundationally led to twentieth century civil rights movements. While exploring these themes, the course will also analyze the complexities and contractions (i.e. Southern Baptist Convention, Nation of Islam and Black Lives Matter) inherent in resistance movements based on spiritual leadership"
AMST 2220,From the New Deal to the Age of Reagan,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 2220,(HA-AS),,,"This seminar will explore some of the major political and cultural trends in the United States,  from the era of the Democratic New Dealer, Franklin D. Roosevelt, through the era of the conservative Republican, Ronald Reagan? This seminar will explore through primary source research and secondary readings  the key economic, political, and cultural characteristics and transformations of the period from 1930 though the turn of the century.  The course will examine the rise, persistence, and breakdown of the so-called ""New Deal Order"" and the crucial political shifts that we call the ""Reagan Revolution."" A key theme in this course will be the transformations and critiques of American liberalism and conservatism"
AMST 2320,Latino Music in the US,3,Graded,Spring,,,"LSP 2320, MUSIC 2320, SPAN 2330",(CA-AS),,,"Music and dance cultures have been central topics of study in the development of Chicano studies, Puerto Rican studies, and Latino studies in general. From Americo Paredes to Frances Aparicio and from Jose Limon to Deborah Pacini-Hernandez, focusing on music and embodied culture through sound has allowed scholars to engage the wide variety of cultural experiences of the different ethnic groups usually described with the term ""Latino."" Taking this scholarship as a point of departure, this class offers a survey of Latino music in the U.S. as a window into the political, cultural and social that struggles Mexicans, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, Brazilians, Colombians, and Central Americans have gone through while becoming hyphenated (Eg. Mexican-American, Cuban American, etc) or not, and into how these processes have continually challenged and enriched mainstream notions of ""American identity."""
AMST 2405,The Italian-American Experience,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ITAL 2400,(LA-AS),,,"Between 1880 and 1920, 4 million Italians moved to the United States in search of better fortunes. As a result, today there are 17 million US citizens of Italian descent, among them famed artists and celebrities such as Martin Scorsese, John Turturro, Madonna, and Lady Gaga.  Italian-Americans have left their mark on art, food, music, cinema, and television, creating a new vibrant culture. In this course, we will look at different cultural products that result from this cultural hybridity, chronicling the Italian-American journey from Ellis Island to show business.  The examined texts will include novels, memoirs and films, with particular emphasis on the work of female authors such as Helen Barolini, Kym Ragusa, and Louise de Salvo. Throughout the course, we will grapple with questions of gender and race, hybridity and identity, and we will explore the linguistic and visual strategies used by the authors to suggest a feeling of displacement"
AMST 2504,Obama and the Meaning of Race,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 2504, GOVT 2604, SOC 2520",(SBA-AS),,,"The election of Barack Obama to the presidency has raised new questions in the American debate on race, politics, and social science. Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista"

AMST 2581,Environmental History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"BSOC 2581, HIST 2581",(HA-AS),(HB),,"This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context. This course is meant to be open to all, including non-majors and first-year students"

AMST 2621,"Gendering Religion, Science and Technology",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"FGSS 2621, STS 2621",(KCM-AS),,,"There are several ""just-so stories"" about science and religion: the world's religions are parallel systems of belief in the supernatural; science has a set method that produces universal truths; and religion and science are in perpetual conflict. This course will challenge these understandings by introducing students to the study of religion, science, and technology, as well as to ways to think about their relationships. To bring these categories down to earth and unsettle engrained scholarly and popular narratives, our approach will be to gender the study of religion, science, and technology. To do so, we will not simply ""add women and stir,"" to borrow a phrase from feminist historians; rather, we will query how gender, sexuality, and embodiment shape the very construction of knowledge itself"

AMST 2660,Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIIS 2660, HIST 2660",(HA-AS),(HB),,"One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills"
AMST 2680,Culture and Politics of the 1960s,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 2680,(CA-AS),,,"Fifty years ago, American society exploded; but 1968 was only a moment in the decade when the civil rights movement, the counter culture, and the Vietnam war stimulated alternative lifestyles and powerful dissents that changed the world forever. What can the triumphant and tragic events of the 1960s, and the literary works they inspired, teach a later generation living through a similar crisis of social transformation? This interdisciplinary course puts cultural texts in the context of a turbulent history. Topics include racial justice, the antiwar movement, the New Left, second-wave feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and the music of resistance. Texts will include The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five, music of Dylan and Joplin, speeches of King, manifestos, memoirs, and poems"

In this course we will explore the perceptions of poverty in the United States through three major American newspapers
AMST 3033,Politics of Public Policy in the U.S,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,GOVT 3032,,,,"Public policies are political outcomes determined by processes that are complex, convoluted and often controversial. The aim of this course is to equip students with the conceptual tools necessary to understand these processes. We will begin with a review of popular approaches to studying policy and then move on to explore the various stages of policy development: agenda-setting, policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback and policy change. We will consider the roles played by both institutions (congress, the bureaucracy and interests groups) and everyday people. Finally, we will closely study several specific policy arenas (a few likely candidates include: education policy, health policy, social welfare policy and housing policy). As we engage all of these ideas, students will be consistently challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making in a democratic polity and to envision pathways for substantive political change.   "

We will read, think, talk and write about the incarceration experience and about policies that shape this experience. We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement"

In particular, we will focus on the complex and often ambiguous relationship between science, technology, and risk. A historical perspective shows how science and technology have generated risks while they have also played key roles in managing and solving those very risks. By examining several case studies, including 19th-century mining, the 1911 Triangle fire, nuclear science, the space shuttle disasters, asbestos litigation, Hurricane Katrina, and the contemporary financial crisis, we will consider how risk and ideas about risk have changed over time. By exploring different historical and cultural responses to risk, we will examine the sociopolitical dimensions of the definitions, perceptions, and management of risk both in the past and the present"

On what basis can we label ""Asians"" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category ""Asian"" itself does not exist in the Caribbean.

The possibilities of editing (via the cut, the loop, or the overdub) on one hand, and the seeming capacity for indiscriminate recording of sound on the other, revealed tape to be a medium with claims both for authentic documentation (and also surveillance), and wide aesthetic reference (but also mass deception). With one ear to the state and another to the music industry, this course will focus on the way politics and the arts responded to and incorporated the new technology.

Our exploration commences through a set of questions to guide our critical inquiry: Does art produce political resistance? Does art produce political consciousness? How can we read poster art and murals as texts or narratives? How does poetry perform or visualize a collective movement and political moment? By centering our study on these questions, we will move through the poster art, murals, and poems of Chicanos/as, U.S. Latinos/as, and African Americans during the 1960s and 1970s. Reading visual image, political proclamations, and spoken word as cultural texts, we will examine art and poetry for their knowledges about community, ethnicity, and racial experience in the U.S"

If a poem illuminates an injustice, what historical context do we need to know? When a poet depicts a humorous image or celebrates the body of a lover, does the poem – by virtue of its authorship – disturb stereotypes? These questions and more will direct our inquiry into how Indigenous poets represent and strategically re-invent Euro-American literary forms to revitalize Indigenous aesthetic traditions and register resistance to oppression. We'll read numerous Indigenous poetic voices from across the continent, and see how they range from caustic criticism of EuroAmerican values, celebrate Indigenous relationships to place, and reject the role of victim or subjugation through trickster play and humor"

Five centuries have not diminished either the overwhelming importance or the strangeness of the early encounter between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Taking a comparative approach, this course will conceptualize early American history as the product of reciprocal cultural encounters by assessing the various experiences of Spanish, French, and English newcomers in different regions of the Americas.

How is the work of governance carried out in the United States? What kinds of institutional arrangements are employed, and how have they developed? What are the consequences for governance? Answering these questions immerses us in the study of American political development to assess the evolution, character, and scope of the administrative state and of other arrangements-typically channeled through the private sector-through which the nation implements public policies. In the processes, the course grapples with analytical questions about processes of political change and considers a variety of theoretical approaches. Variants of ""new institutionalism"" will be highlighted, as well as reflections on the puzzles of American exceptionalism. The body of the course will investigate such topics as the development of public bureaucracy, the emergence of the civil service, and the evolution of the regulatory state and the welfare state.

This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

""Asians"" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the ""Asians?"" On what basis can we label ""Asians"" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category ""Asian"" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States. Ethnographic case studies will focus on the East Indian and Chinese experiences in the Caribbean and the Chinese, Korean, Japanese, Filipino, and Indian experiences in the United States"

It is a region long anchored to tropes of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. It is also a place in which liminality, betwixt and between Europe and Asia, endures as both a perceived geographic imaginary and an experienced condition in the detritus of imperialisms past. The Caucasus's extraordinary diversity in languages and ethnicities has generated a deep suspicion of it by those surrounding the region, and has sparked profound social tragedies. But it has also stimulated a curiosity that has generated meditations on culture, identity, and social life.

In some cases, the verses do not seem to fit the context; in others, they violate standard rules of Arabic grammar. Some in the Muslim tradition take these verses as evidence of the miraculous nature of the language of the Quran whose secrets only Allah knows. A number of modern scholars, particularly in the West, have tried to understand them by reference to Semitic languages, particularly Syriac and Hebrew, or by reference to Christian and Jewish traditions, which had a substantial influence on the language of the Quran. Some scholars have gone so far as to offer alternative readings of the Quranic text or to propose emendations.  Applying the tools of modern linguistic analysis, we will examine a sample of these passages, read their standard Muslim interpretation (tafsiir), identify grammatical and textual problems and propose alternative interpretations that arguably produce a semantically more coherent and grammatically sounder text"

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

It is a region long anchored to tropes of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. It is also a place in which liminality, betwixt and between Europe and Asia, endures as both a perceived geographic imaginary and an experienced condition in the detritus of imperialisms past. The Caucasus's extraordinary diversity in languages and ethnicities has generated a deep suspicion of it by those surrounding the region, and has sparked profound social tragedies. But it has also stimulated a curiosity that has generated meditations on culture, identity, and social life.

In this course we will study Asia's kingdoms, states, and empires, with attention to both tradition and present-day modern states. Focusing on kingship as both ideology and practice, we will study how states and monarchic traditions first came to be, including as Stranger-Kings, Buddhist monarchs, secondary state formation, local adaptations of foreign models, and more. We will examine examples such as China, from the ancient states and early empires to the legacy of empire there today; Cambodia and its Angkor empire modeled on Indian traditions; as well as Burma, Thailand, Japan, and other parts of Asia. Using readings, films, lectures and guest presentations, we will re-examine the role of kingship in Asia so as to enable a new understanding of both ancient, historical, and contemporary Asia. "

It is a region long anchored to tropes of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. It is also a place in which liminality, betwixt and between Europe and Asia, endures as both a perceived geographic imaginary and an experienced condition in the detritus of imperialisms past. The Caucasus's extraordinary diversity in languages and ethnicities has generated a deep suspicion of it by those surrounding the region, and has sparked profound social tragedies. But it has also stimulated a curiosity that has generated meditations on culture, identity, and social life.

ARTH 3440,"Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael, and their World",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,VISST 3443,(HA-AS),(HB),,"Leonardo, Michelangelo, and Raphael transformed the art of their time. Leonardo was an extraordinary thinker, scientist, and engineer as well as artist. Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo. Florentine painters and sculptors grappled with Michelangelo's enormous inventiveness. We will also examine prints in the Johnson Museum after Michelangelo and Raphael, and consider recent attributions of new discoveries to them"

In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics. Investigating the logics of contemporary digital media in relation to the field of political expression, the course complicates received notions of non-Western political public spheres as illiberal, or lagging behind a stage of political development posited as normative"

Focusing on kingship as both ideology and practice, we will study how states and monarchic traditions first came to be, including as Stranger-Kings, Buddhist monarchs, secondary state formation, local adaptations of foreign models, and more. We will examine examples such as China, from the ancient states and early empires to the legacy of empire there today; Cambodia and its Angkor empire modeled on Indian traditions; as well as Burma, Thailand, Japan, and other parts of Asia.

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics. Investigating the logics of contemporary digital media in relation to the field of political expression, the course complicates received notions of non-Western political public spheres as illiberal, or lagging behind a stage of political development posited as normative"

In the second section, we examine the Haitian Revolution in order to describe and interrogate the philosophical and historical relations between master and slave. In the third section, we look at writings such as the Communist manifesto and Che Guevara' essays in order to analyze the difficulties of articulating the relationship between man and socialism in Cuba.

Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen"

This focus has led to major adjustments in US priorities in Africa, including the pairing of diplomacy, defense, and development into new forms of cooperation and intervention. One of the framework for the new approach is the Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) under which the US has associated ten African countries in its global fight against terrorism. The TSCTP is predicated on the idea that significant areas of Africa, peopled as they are by weak states, could become a safe haven for terrorist groups linked with al-Qaeda, the Salafists, and other radical Islamic groups including ISIL today. This course explores the operations of the TSCTP and points of friction between the US and the populations of the zone of implementation. We will place special emphasis on African suspicions of some key tenets of the war on terrorism and skepticism of the methods adopted in the war on terrorism. Key among these are the principle of securing the primary of counterterrorism and the necessary institutional frictions that arise when considering development and good governance"

Our exploration commences through a set of questions to guide our critical inquiry: Does art produce political resistance? Does art produce political consciousness? How can we read poster art and murals as texts or narratives? How does poetry perform or visualize a collective movement and political moment? By centering our study on these questions, we will move through the poster art, murals, and poems of Chicanos/as, U.S. Latinos/as, and African Americans during the 1960s and 1970s.

Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

If we did, we would end up with a robust, sophisticated discourse properly denominated 'Modern African Political Philosophy' in which we recognize, possibly celebrate and, ultimately, assess the quality of answers that African thinkers have provided.   In this Seminar, we shall be reading original works by African thinkers and do so in the context of modern political philosophy.  Participants in the course will work to create critical literature in response to these works as part of a more general effort to begin to create secondary resources in this relatively unexplored area of scholarship about Africa.  Each participant will be expected to produce a final piece that can be a candidate for, minimally, presentation at a learned conference and, maximally, publication in a journal.

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class.

In this course, students will be learning about and seeing cutting-edge research in modern laboratories. Critically, they will see what the practice of science is like. The course will have three modules, each centered on the lab of a different Cornell faculty member. First, there will be a lecture by the STEM faculty member on their research that is targeted to the freshmen audience and emphasizes the importance of work, its application, and the process of discovery and exploration that is intrinsic to the research. During the ~2 weeks following the lecture, students in the course will spend a one day shadowing graduate students and post-docs in the STEM faculty member's lab. Students will write a short description of what they saw and how it relates to the broader goals of the lab they learned about from the lecture. After all students have shadowed, there will be a second meeting that includes the students, and the scientists they shadowed, and the STEM faculty member. The focus of this second meeting will be discussing the experiments they saw, how they worked, how those measurements connect to the bigger picture goals for the laboratory and the project, as well as the nature of the relationships among the graduate students, post-docs, and faculty that enable this research. Finally, students will read and critically analyze a paper from the faculty member's lab, with a third and final meeting to discuss how this final scientific product relates to the people, experiments, and process of science they saw in the lab and discussed.

In particular, we will focus on the complex and often ambiguous relationship between science, technology, and risk. A historical perspective shows how science and technology have generated risks while they have also played key roles in managing and solving those very risks. By examining several case studies, including 19th-century mining, the 1911 Triangle fire, nuclear science, the space shuttle disasters, asbestos litigation, Hurricane Katrina, and the contemporary financial crisis, we will consider how risk and ideas about risk have changed over time. By exploring different historical and cultural responses to risk, we will examine the sociopolitical dimensions of the definitions, perceptions, and management of risk both in the past and the present"

This course looks not only at animals in their social lives, but also at animals in their lives with us. We ask questions about how species become entangled and what that means for both parties, about the social lives of animals independently and with humans, about the survival of human and animal species, and about what it means to use animals for science, food, and profit. The course draws on readings from Anthropology, Science & Technology Studies, and animal trainers and behaviorists"

It covers the main topics and questions regarding bodies, diseases, and medical institutions within the framework of major historical developments in world and region's history. The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

This senior seminar offers an interdisciplinary exploration of infectious diseases.  Our investigations take us from medieval Europe's ""Black Plague,"" to Tuberculosis in early twentieth century United States and its global resurgence at the turn of the twenty-first, to Ebola and its ongoing, periodic outbreaks today. We consider the consequences epidemics have for how we live and imagine shared ecological futures.  Examining work from the life sciences, social sciences, and arts & humanities, we explore the ways in which life and death, disease and survivability, health and thriving are shaped by infectious microbes, embodied eco-social forces, and contingent regimes of knowledge-power. "

This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

COML 4001,Aesthetics of Authenticity,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"A comprehensive survey of philosophical aesthetics from its inception in the 18th century to the present, this class will pay special attention to questions of authenticity and originality. Theories of art can be placed on a scale with conscious human making, i.e. calculated application of rules on the one end and divinely inspired creation or unconscious imitation of nature on the other. Art is per definition artificial, but the discipline of aesthetics has often privileged the natural and the naïve. Rousseau viewed the arts as corrupting, and Kant saw an interest in natural – not manmade – beauty as a sign of moral character. Classicism favored the simplicity of a young culture, while the Romantics called for immediacy and spontaneity. In the 20th century, modernist avant-gardes turned to the very earliest forms of human expression. Can aesthetics help us understand our fascination with the innate, the innocent, and even the ignorant? How do we distinguish authentic from fraudulent art? What counts as artistic originality? Is it possible to know too much to make or to enjoy artworks? Exploring these issues, we will be in constant dialog with figures like Wordsworth, Kleist, de Staël, Nietzsche, Rimbaud, Heidegger, and Cavell"

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa"
COML 6159,Literary Theory on the Edge,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 3021, ENGL 3021, ENGL 6021, PMA 3421",,,,"Without literary theory, there is no idea of literature, of criticism, of culture.

COML 6285,Early Modern Translations,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 6285,,,,"Translation is a cultural, conceptual, and political problem. It lies at the heart of the literary itself. Methodological discussions of ""world"" literature hinge on it, and Renaissance culture is unthinkable apart from it. The Renaissance—defined in terms of transmission and reception of ancient texts—is itself, in a way, translation. Tied to philosophical and theo-political problems of origin and copy, Truth and falsehood, fidelity, heresy and betrayal (as the Italian maxim traduttore, traditore attests), translation raises questions of sameness and identity, originality, authority, property, sacredness and evil. The seminar explores these questions in texts from Luther, Cervantes and Montaigne, through Benjamin, Derrida and Agamben. Particular focus is on the early modern as template and groundwork for the complexity and centrality of translation to life"
COML 6702,Italian Thought,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ITAL 6510,,,,"Deleuze and Guattari famously quipped that Italy lacked ""a milieu"" for philosophy, that its thinkers remained comets and that Italy had the habit of ""burning"" its comets. In this course we will not take issue so much with Deleuze and Guattari's evaluation as wonder if the period from the Italian 1968 to today might not in fact represent the elaboration of a ""philosophical milieu"" for Italian thought. As such the questions we will take up in this seminar concern the notion of milieu as a middle ground between philosophical extremes and subsequently, an investigation into what contemporary Italian political philosophers share.  Readings from Giorgio Agamben, Michael Hardt and Toni Negri, Roberto Esposito, Franco Berard (""Bifo""), Paolo Virno, Adriana Cavarero, Rosi Braidotti, as well as some works of a new generation of scholars will be discussed"
COML 6707,Surface Theories,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Contemporary theory has turned surface phenomena into the grounds and foundations for conceptual work: from moebius-strips to simulacra, from skin to screens, from folds to planes. But theory's ""superficial"" turn has led to radically different critical uses. What accounts for the pervasive fascination with surface imaginaries in theoretical thought? This course will engage us in a series of critical reflections on the deployment, as well as the folding and warping, of figures of superficiality, flatness, smoothness, transparence, and nakedness in contemporary theory, from deconstruction to biopolitics, from media studies to queer and transgender theory, from animal and environmental studies to phenomenology, from systems theory to aesthetics. Readings will include texts by Baudrillard, Deleuze and Guattari, Derrida, Han, Didi-Huberman, Foucault, Lyotard, Nancy, Serres, Sloterdijk and others"
COML 6865,Contemporary Poetry and Poetics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4860, ENGL 4980, ENGL 6880, ROMS 6860, SPAN 4860",,,,"What gives contemporary poetry and poetics its resonance and value? What are its dominant features, audiences, and purposes? What does 21st-century poetry's environment look like, and how does it situate itself among other genres, discourses, disciplines, media? How would we describe its ambient noise and how does that noise shape, inform, inflect its particular concerns and motivated forms? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a range of works from the past two decades that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions especially of language, aesthetics, and politics. "

ECON 7530,Industry Dynamics,2,Stdnt Opt,Spring (weeks 8-14),,,,,,,"This is an advanced study course in Industry Dynamics. Much improvement has been made in the study of aggregate productivity, investment, and aggregate output dynamics by understanding the micro structure of the economy. This course introduces the main tools exploited in the literature to study these macroeconomic problems and discusses the research frontier. The course opens up with a theory of entrepreneurship and occupational choice. Then it describes firms growth and its impact on industry equilibrium. It introduces techniques for computation of productivity and marginal products at the firm level and its implications for cross-country disparities in income per capital and the life cycle of firms. Next, we analyze economies consistent with industry equilibrium and endogenous long-run growth. For that, we build basic notions on stochastic calculus which are used at the frontier of research. Finally, we study industry equilibrium in open economies and in economies with incomplete markets. The course closes with a normative analysis of industry equilibrium allocations. Due to the brevity of the course, there is only a limited number of papers that can be covered in detail. The course, however, should endow students with the tools necessary to approach the literature and highlight the questions that remain to be answered. The course is designed to encourage avenues for novel research"

One of the ways we do this is by incorporating adult learning approaches within the seminar's design and educational practice (andragogy, rather than pedagogy). Another way we apply what we study is by mentoring adult learners.  Each student serves as a learning partner to a Cornell employee who is pursuing an educational aim. A journey of mutual learning is a satisfying and meaningful adventure. As employees' partners, we are co-learners and co-educators, recognizing that each person has knowledge and experience to bring to the quest. "

From professional development to social change, town hall to union hall, or citizen science to workplace training, adult and community learning is everywhere. Yet, for many, the design and facilitation of meaningful learning experiences can be a s mysterious as an unopened black box. How does one go about creating inclusive educational experiences for diverse learners in our increasingly interconnected context?  In this course we open the box to become better leaders of learning and action.  A democatic and socially just society should enable all of its citizens to develop their potential to the full and to have the capacity, individually and collectively, to meet the challenge of change.  Through learning, people can come to make a real contribution to their own communities and participate in local and national democratic processes.  Two of the most ubiquitous formats of adult learning are 1) the workshop, and 2) one-on-one mentoring. As a backwards design approach and interactive facilitation principles can serve each application well, we will learn and practice both! In this course you will a) design and facilitate workshops, and b) mentor a Cornell employee as they pursues a learning goal, and do both by learning and applying design process and facilitation arts.  Meaningful. Practical. Fun"

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development.

The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development.

These are some of the most vital questions in literatures from Britain, the U.S, the Caribbean, and Africa. We will consider some of the texts that engage these questions including those by authors such as William Wordsworth, Frederick Douglass, Jane Austen, Walt Whitman, T S Eliot, Langston Hughes, Elizabeth Bishop, Sandra Cisneros, Toni Morrison, Louise Erdrich, Joy Harjo, and Chinua Achebe"

ENGL 2080,Shakespeare and the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PMA 2681,(LA-AS),(HB),,"What can we learn about Shakespeare's plays from their reception by late modernity?

Within the historical context of the Holocaust and how and why it occurred, we shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We also study ethical and psychological issues about how and why people behave in dire circumstances. We shall begin with first-person reminiscences—Wiesel's Night, Levi's Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank—before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally's Schindler's List (and Spielberg's film), Kertesz's Fateless, Kosinski's The Painted Bird, and Ozick's ""The Shawl.""

What can the triumphant and tragic events of the 1960s, and the literary works they inspired, teach a later generation living through a similar crisis of social transformation? This interdisciplinary course puts cultural texts in the context of a turbulent history. Topics include racial justice, the antiwar movement, the New Left, second-wave feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and the music of resistance.

ENGL 2755,"Birds, Beasts, and Bards: The Poetry of Animals",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"If you love animals but are sad because you can't keep them in your dorm room, poems may well be the perfect substitute. Evoking the bodies and spirits of non-human creatures has always been one of the special domains of poetry. In this course, we'll consider a wide range of poems that take many different approaches to unlocking the mysterious otherness of animals, using all the tricks and techniques of this venerable art: rhythm, form, metaphor, observation and imagination. In discussions and essays we'll explore the ways in which poems about animals raise major questions of ethics and epistemology, while achieving the primal magic of translating life into language. Poets to be studied include Blake, Whitman, Dickinson, Frost, Lawrence, Moore, Bishop, Hughes, and many others"

ENGL 3120,Beowulf,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6120, MEDVL 3120, MEDVL 6120",(LA-AS),(HB),,"In recent years, Beowulf has received renewed attention in popular culture, thanks to the production of two recent Beowulf movies and riveting new translations (eg. Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"
ENGL 3190,Chaucer,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MEDVL 3190,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Chaucer became known as the ""father of English poetry"" before he was entirely cold in his grave. Why is what he wrote more than six hundred years ago still riveting for us today? It's not just because he is the granddaddy of this language and its literature; it's because what he wrote was funny, fierce, thoughtful, political, philosophical and, oh yes, notoriously bawdy. We'll read some of Chaucer's brilliant early work, and then dig into his two greatest achievements: the epic Troilus and Crisyede, and The Canterbury Tales, his oft-censored panorama of medieval English life. Chaucer will be read in Middle English, which will prove surprisingly easy and pleasant"
ENGL 3230,Renaissance Poetry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"From the Renaissance to the present, love and its codes have intrigued writers and readers.

This course is for anyone interested in poetry, regardless of background, willing to work in a small discussion setting to examine the craft of lyric, ponder questions, think about the aesthetic and social stakes of reading Renaissance poetry. Some authors and poems will be familiar to you (Shakespeare, Donne), others will be new. Our goal is to open windows for reading them. Expect the unexpected and some serious fun with rich material"

This class will introduce students to English literature from 1940 to the present, investigating how novels (both ""genre"" and ""high literary""), poems, and comics have taken on new voices through their encounter with vast cultural and political changes. Beginning with Woolf's final novel, a cavalcade of English culture written in the shadow of war, we will proceed to study authors who explored the state of the nation through kitchen-sink realism, multicultural collage, and warped fantasy: Sam Selvon, Angela Carter, Philip Larkin, Kazuo Ishiguro, Alan Moore, J.K. Rowling, and others"
ENGL 3660,Reading the Nineteenth-Century American Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 3661,(LA-AS),(HB),,"The course asks you to think about the role of fiction in producing a sense of history, politics, and culture in the nineteenth-century United States.

Authors include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Pauline Hopkins, and Fanny Fern"
ENGL 3675,The Environmental Imagination in American Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 3675,(LA-AS),,,"This course focuses on works that exemplify environmental consciousness—a sense that humans are not the center of the world and that to think they are may have catastrophic consequences for humans themselves. Environmental literature is not just a major strand of American literature but one of its most distinctive contributions to the literature of the world. We will be reading works mainly from the 19th and 20th centuries, both poetry and fiction, confronting the challenges of thinking and writing with an ecological consciousness in the 21st. Cornell being a rich environment in which to pursue such investigations, creative projects will be encouraged. Inspiration is assured"

ENGL 3705,Serial Stories: Television and the Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,"Spring, summer",,,,(LA-AS),,,"The past two decades have seen a whole new kind of television: long, multi-plot narratives spun out over many seasons. Some producers have made use of this serial mode to offer complex and inventive models of social analysis. These often share goals with the serial storytelling of the past, including cartoons and novels, and draw on similar strategies. We will watch such series as The Wire, Mad Men, and Game of Thrones, and we will read serialized fictions, including Wilkie Collins' page-turner, The Woman in White, in the spring, and other texts in the summer"
ENGL 3762,Law and Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6710, GOVT 6045, LAW 6710",(LA-AS),,,"What can lawyers and judges learn from the study of literature? This course explores the relevance of imaginative literature (novels, drama, poetry, and film) to questions of law and social justice from a range of perspectives. We will consider debates about how literature can help to humanize legal decision-making; how storytelling has helped to give voice to oppressed populations over history; how narratives of suffering cultivate popular support for human rights; the role played by storytelling in a trial; and how literature can shed light on the limits of law and public policy"

ENGL 3890,The Personal Voice: Nonfiction Writing,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Writers of creative nonfiction plumb the depths of their experience and comment memorably on the passing scene. They write reflectively on themselves and journalistically on the activities and artifacts of others. The voice they seek is at once uniquely personal, objectively persuasive, and accessible to others who want relish their view of the world and learn from it. This course is for the maturely self-motivated writer (beyond the first year of college) who wants to experiment with style and voice to find new writerly personae in a workshop environment. During the semester, we'll read enabling models of literary nonfiction, including one another's, and work to develop a portfolio of diverse and polished writing"
ENGL 3910,Poetry and Poetics of the Americas,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 3820, COML 3800, LATA 3800, SPAN 3800",(LA-AS),,,"As globalization draws the Americas ever closer together, reshaping our sense of a common and uncommon American culture, what claims might be made for a distinctive, diverse poetry and poetics of the America? How might we characterize its dominant forms and alternative practices? What shared influences, affiliations, concerns and approaches might we find and what differences emerge? Ranging across North and South America, Central America and the Caribbean, this course will place in conversation such figures as Poe, Stein, Eliot, Pound, Williams, Neruda, Vallejo, Borges, Parra, Césaire, Walcott, Bolaño, Espada, Waldrop, Vicuña, Hong, and Rankine"

We will analyze literary media, such as interactive graphic novels, text-based web art, multimedia poetry, unconventional novels and blogs in order to study Asian racial formation and cultural production.

ENGL 3920,Introduction to Critical Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 3541, GERST 3620, GOVT 3636",(LA-AS),,,"Shortly after the last election, The New Yorker published an article entitled ""The Frankfurt School Knew Trump was Coming."" This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"
ENGL 4020,Literature as Moral Inquiry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot's Middlemarch, Coetzee's Disgrace, Morrison's Beloved, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and Achebe's Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro"

As a class, we will focus on the formative period of English literature: from Chaucer to Shakespeare, roughly, both of which you will read in their original Englishes. Individual projects, however, can take up any period or language so long as this serves as an opportunity to investigate issues where material book-culture meets cultural and literary history—including the theoretical problems of editing something for modern users. The final project will involve a small edition of some work or copy that you study independently, plus discussion of some of the forces or issues that the work or text brings to bear"
ENGL 4291,American Shakespeare,4,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,"AMST 4194, PMA 4190",(LA-AS),(HB),,"What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton. While encountering a number of plays, students will have the opportunity to see at least three live performances and numerous movies, consider the history of Shakespeare in America and learn from actors, directors, scholars and designers"
ENGL 4415,Victorian Poetry and Poetics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 6415,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Both a general introduction to poetic theory and a close study of Victorian poetry in its immense variety. We'll draw on Culler's Theory of the Lyric and other texts not only to interpret poems but also to consider their conditions of possibility of meaning. Topics will include: the relationship of lyric to dramatic, or performative, speakers; the absorption of aesthetics into poetics through the trope of ""art""; shifting conceptions of poetic genius, gender, and personality; theories of the grotesque; and experiments in poetic narrative. We'll bring these topics to bear on a shared experience of poetry itself—rhythm and movement, sound patterns, lines vs syntax, and the interplay of stylistic levels. Poets will include Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Christina Rossetti, Swinburne, and Hardy"
ENGL 4501,African Women Writers Critique the PostColonial State,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 4501, ASRC 6105, FGSS 4501",(LA-AS),(GB),,"This course reads and discusses representative literature from 20th century continental African writers with particular attention to the ways that African women examine the nature of the post-colonial state. We will focus on women writers but will but will set them against the context of the development of modern African literatures on the continent and in the African Diaspora.  We will also read some male texts and view some film which elucidate some specific angles of vision. We will examine specific texts as well as necessary critical and theoretical ideas which have been generated through, or with which this literature is in conversation.   Students will develop critical thinking and other analytical skills as they engage the meanings  of writing, audience, language and gender in African contexts"
ENGL 4509,Toni Morrison's Novels,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 4519, ASRC 4509, ASRC 6513, ENGL 6513, FGSS 4509, FGSS 6513",(LA-AS),,,"Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison received her M.A. in English at Cornell University in 1955.  To study her, in a way, is to gain a deeper understanding of how she journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, and  how she has  shaped  Cornell's great legacy.  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the ""love trilogy"" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored"
ENGL 4535,The Modern Imagination: The Major Authors,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4832, ENGL 6530",(LA-AS),,,"Following my credo, ""Always the text; always historicize,"" The Modern Imagination: Major Authors has been a successful course for relatively advanced undergraduates as well as for Ph.D students and MFAs. It is an indispensable, probing, and pleasurable course for those studying nineteenth, twentieth, and contemporary century Anglophone and European literature. Our readings will include works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Proust, Kafka, Mann, Ferrante, Kundera,and W. G. Sebald as well as the poetry of T.S.Eliot, Yeats, and Steven/s. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, but we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. We shall also be aware of critical and theoretical approaches. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism and as well as Post-Modernism. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture. Within the very broad course rubric, students will be able to select the special topics on which they write essays and perhaps formulate subjects for further study"
ENGL 4610,The American Short Story,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"The course begins with the fiction of that wild man Poe, whose work has been energizing American art for almost two centuries. Then it examines the realisms, super-realisms, fantasies, and mythologies in the short fiction of later writers who might include Mark Twain, Charles Waddell Chestnutt, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Vladimir Nabokov, Ernest Hemingway, Flannery O'Connor, Donald Barthelme, Denis Johnson, Raymond Carver, Ursula K. Le Guin, Jhumpa Lahiri, Sandra Cisneros, Gish Jen, Julie Schumacher, Tobias Wolff, Junot Díaz, Hannah Tinti, Z. Z. Packer, and Martin Pousson. The stories will be juxtaposed in ways that will allow us to read contemporary work in the context of the obsessions that energized the work of the earlier writers, those who made the short story form one of the most radical of American art forms"
ENGL 4619,Writing on Tape in the 1970s,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4619, MUSIC 4454, SHUM 4619",,,,"This course examines the way audiotape both corrupted and enabled the aesthetic and political culture of the 1970s. The possibilities of editing (via the cut, the loop, or the overdub) on one hand, and the seeming capacity for indiscriminate recording of sound on the other, revealed tape to be a medium with claims both for authentic documentation (and also surveillance), and wide aesthetic reference (but also mass deception). With one ear to the state and another to the music industry, this course will focus on the way politics and the arts responded to and incorporated the new technology. Authors include Andy Warhol, Alvin Lucier, Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, The Last Poets, The Firesign Theatre, The Credibility Gap, Adrian Piper"
ENGL 4635,Art! Poetry! Power!,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4633, ASRC 4635, LSP 4635",(LA-AS),,,"This course begins in the center of the poetry, politics, and art of the U.S. civil rights movements, but also makes connections with the poetic and visual cultures of twenty-first century activism. Our exploration commences through a set of questions to guide our critical inquiry: Does art produce political resistance? Does art produce political consciousness? How can we read poster art and murals as texts or narratives? How does poetry perform or visualize a collective movement and political moment? By centering our study on these questions, we will move through the poster art, murals, and poems of Chicanos/as, U.S. Latinos/as, and African Americans during the 1960s and 1970s. Reading visual image, political proclamations, and spoken word as cultural texts, we will examine art and poetry for their knowledges about community, ethnicity, and racial experience in the U.S"
ENGL 4670,Native American Poetry of Resistance,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AIIS 4670, AMST 4670",(LA-AS),,,"What techniques, tools, and contexts are needed to perform reasonably well-informed readings and interpretations of Native American poetry? If a poem illuminates an injustice, what historical context do we need to know? When a poet depicts a humorous image or celebrates the body of a lover, does the poem – by virtue of its authorship – disturb stereotypes? These questions and more will direct our inquiry into how Indigenous poets represent and strategically re-invent Euro-American literary forms to revitalize Indigenous aesthetic traditions and register resistance to oppression. We'll read numerous Indigenous poetic voices from across the continent, and see how they range from caustic criticism of EuroAmerican values, celebrate Indigenous relationships to place, and reject the role of victim or subjugation through trickster play and humor"
ENGL 4720,New Latinx Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4720, ENGL 6720, LSP 4720, LSP 6720",,,,"Contemporary Latinx writing explores an extraordinary range of experiences using a variety of experimental forms. This course will examine the poetry, fiction, memoirs, plays, and new media produced within the last fifteen years by a new generation of Latinx writers and artists.

What are its dominant features, audiences, and purposes? What does 21st-century poetry's textual environment look like, and how does it situate itself among other genres, discourses, disciplines, media? How would we describe its ambient noise and how does that noise shape, inform, inflect its particular concerns and motivated forms? How does contemporary poetry resist, engage, respond to, sound out that noise? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal cultural, economic, historical, philosophical, political developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a wide range of works that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions of personal and collective identity and language in contexts at once local and global. Poets include Armantrout, Bernstein, Collins, Espada, Gander, Fitterman, Goldsmith, Hong, Osman, Place, Rich, Smith, and Waldrop"
ENGL 4995,Body Politics in African Literature and Cinema,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 4995, COML 4945, FGSS 4945, LGBT 4945, VISST 4945",(CA-AS),(GB),,"The course examines how postcolonial African writers and filmmakers engage with and revise controversial images of bodies and sexuality--genital cursing, same-sex desire, HIV/AIDS, genital surgeries, etc. Our inquiry also surveys African theorists' troubling of problematic tropes and practices such as the conception in 19th-century racist writings of the colonized as embodiment, the pathologization and hypersexualization of colonized bodies, and the precarious and yet empowering nature of the body and sexuality in the postcolonial African experience. As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa"
ENGL 4997,Joyce and the Graveyard of Digital Empires,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,SHUM 4621,,,,"A survey of digital media scholarship from 1970 to 2000 that takes as its focal point Joyce's 1922 novel, Ulysses—one of the most influential literary works of the 20th century—this seminar investigates major theories of media and literature in relation to the emergence of electronic media technologies. Drawing upon critical theory, media history, and specific artistic and scholarly projects in old and new media, the course asks how and why Joyce came to be used as a defining figure of the ""golden age"" of hypertext theory: both an exemplary artist and an ultimate editorial challenge. Of special interest to the course is the fate of scholarly projects that took Joyce as their subject, for the challenges of sustainability that the first wave of digital scholarly projects encountered—challenges that reflect on more general problems of preservation in the digital environment, like data corruption, memory failures, and link rot—give rise to important questions about loss, failure, and memory in the history of the digital humanities. Themes that the course explores include hypertext theory, poststructuralist theory, electronic scholarly projects, histories of computing, histories of the book, concepts of the ""social text,"" and the history of predictions about the fate of traditional written forms in an electronic world. Authors and works include James Joyce, Marshall McLuhan, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, George Landow, Jay David Bolter, Hans Walter Gabler, Michael Groden, Jerome McGann, and interactive digital texts"
ENGL 5800,Graduate Creative Writing Special Seminar,2,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This Graduate Creative Writing Special Seminar allows writing students to learn about craft from a visiting creative writer. Exact content will vary depending on the instructor, but all seminars will take an in-depth look at the craft of writing. In Spring 2018, the topic is: Ishion! Alice! Joanie! Lyrae! Let's read faculty members' poems and then talk about them behind their backs. (We'll talk about Robert as well, time permitting.)  Instead of a seminar room and critical writing, we'll meet to respond to their work with poems of our own. Our purpose is to discover what makes their voices tick, what obsessions drive their aesthetic choices, what sensibility shapes their diction and syntax. What happens when we twist their poetics to our own urgencies? Is imitation truly flattering? Is it even possible?"
ENGL 6021,Literary Theory on the Edge,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 3021, COML 6159, ENGL 3021, PMA 3421",,,,"Without literary theory, there is no idea of literature, of criticism, of culture. While exciting theoretical paradigms emerged in the late 20th century, including structuralism and poststructuralism, this course extends theoretical inquiry into its most exciting current developments, including performance studies, media theory and cinema/media studies, the digital humanities, trauma theory, trangender studies, and studies of the Anthropocene. Taught by two Cornell professors active in the field, along with occasional invited guests, lectures and class discussions will provide students with a facility for close textual analysis, a knowledge of major currents of thought in the humanities, and an appreciation for the uniqueness and complexity of language and media. This course may involve presentation of performance art.  Course open to all levels; no previous knowledge of literary or cultural theory required"
ENGL 6120,Beowulf,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,"one semester's study of Old English, or the equivalent, is recommended",,"ENGL 3120, MEDVL 3120, MEDVL 6120",,,,"Beowulf has received renewed attention in popular culture, thanks to the production of recent movies and riveting new translations. The poem's popular appeal lies in its complex depictions of monsters, its accounts of heroic bravery, and its lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""darker side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention will be given to the poem's cultural contexts, its literary heritage, and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives. A bilingual edition of the poem will be assigned so that students may read in Old and Modern English"
ENGL 6171,The Archaeology of the Text from Chaucer through the Renaissance,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 4170, MEDVL 4170, MEDVL 6170",,,,"This seminar will explore and write about manuscripts, handwriting, literacy, printers, and other issues linking material and social book-making to ""literary history."" As a class, we will focus on the formative period of English literature: from Chaucer to Shakespeare, roughly, both of which you will read in their original Englishes. Individual projects, however, can take up any period or language so long as this serves as an opportunity to investigate issues where material book-culture meets cultural and literary history—including the theoretical problems of editing something for modern users. The final project will involve a small edition of some work or copy that you study independently, plus discussion of some of the forces or issues that the work or text brings to bear"
ENGL 6285,Early Modern Translations,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 6285,,,,"Translation is a cultural, conceptual, and political problem. It lies at the heart of the literary itself. Methodological discussions of ""world"" literature hinge on it, and Renaissance culture is unthinkable apart from it. The Renaissance—defined in terms of transmission and reception of ancient texts—is itself, in a way, translation. Tied to philosophical and theo-political problems of origin and copy, Truth and falsehood, fidelity, heresy and betrayal (as the Italian maxim traduttore, traditore attests), translation raises questions of sameness and identity, originality, authority, property, sacredness and evil. The seminar explores these questions in texts from Luther, Cervantes and Montaigne, through Benjamin, Derrida and Agamben. Particular focus is on the early modern as template and groundwork for the complexity and centrality of translation to life"
ENGL 6330,"Eighteenth-Century Literature: Other-than-Human Forms: Materialism, Affect, Ecocriticism, Animal",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"This course juxtaposes some of the core strains of current post-humanist theory—new materialism or ""thing theory,"" the ""affective turn,"" ecocriticism or environmental humanities, and literary animal studies. Using eighteenth-century literature, culture, and intellectual discourse as a starting point and then sampling related materials in the Anglo-American tradition from the twentieth and twenty-first centuries, we will define these theoretical scenarios, and evaluate the broader impact of the other-than-human on literary theory and on formal critique. Texts include Newton, Opticks; Defoe, Robinson Crusoe; Hume, Treatise of Human Nature; Burney, Evelina; Nabokov, Lolita; Cowper, The Task; Voltaire, Candide; Robinson, Forty Signs of Rain; Kendall, Keeper's Travels; The Dog of Knowledge; The Biography of a Spaniel; Auster, Timbuktu. "
ENGL 6415,Victorian Poetry and Poetics,4,Graded,Spring,,,ENGL 4415,,,,"Both a general introduction to poetic theory and a close study of Victorian poetry in its immense variety. We'll draw on Culler's Theory of the Lyric and other texts not only to interpret poems but also to consider their conditions of possibility of meaning. Topics will include: the relationship of lyric to dramatic, or performative, speakers; the absorption of aesthetics into poetics through the trope of ""art""; shifting conceptions of poetic genius, gender, and personality; theories of the grotesque; and experiments in poetic narrative. We'll bring these topics to bear on a shared experience of poetry itself—rhythm and movement, sound patterns, lines vs syntax, and the interplay of stylistic levels. Poets will include Tennyson, Browning, Arnold, Christina Rossetti, Swinburne, and Hardy"
ENGL 6513,Toni Morrison's Novels,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 4519, ASRC 4509, ASRC 6513, ENGL 4509, FGSS 4509, FGSS 6513",,,,"Nobel Laureate Toni Morrison received her M.A. in English at Cornell University in 1955.  To study her, in a way, is to gain a deeper understanding of how she journeyed on from her days as a student here to become one of the world's greatest writers, how she has helped to transform world literature, and  how she has  shaped  Cornell's great legacy.  In this course, we will engage in close and reflective critical readings of Toni Morrison's eleven novels.  Morrison's writing style is characterized by highly distinctive strategies in the development of narrative and in the use of language.  Furthermore, from novel to novel, she is even known for developing features such as the very first sentence with great contemplation, an approach that also demonstrates her commitment to form.  As we journey across her body of work as readers, we will examine a range of recurring themes, along with the ""love trilogy"" on which she focused her repertoire for several years.  The course, through a comprehensive, chronological and focused look at Morrison's body of novels, will help students who entirely lack familiarity with it to gain a strong foundation for further research and study.  By the end of the course, even students who already know Morrison's work will walk away with a deeper and more nuanced critical understanding of it.  The course will help students to reinforce their skills in reading fiction, and help them to become more astute and exacting readers of the novel as a genre.  Morrison's novels have placed her at the vanguard of the globalization of the novel itself, and she is, undisputedly, one the most famous and innovative writers in the world.  She emerged as one of the greatest and most prolific writers of the twentieth century, and her audiences have continued to be captivated by her literary genius in this millennial age.  She is one of the most revered writers within the American literary establishment and has helped to reshape it both as a critic and novelist.  Her work can help one to develop more mastery in reading the novel as a genre.  Indeed, her thinking about this area is so original and pivotal that her fiction and critical works are absolutely indispensable for all serious students and scholars in fields such as American literature.  Its impact on African American literature is equally vital.  We will focus on reading the repertoire of novels by Morrison, including The Bluest Eye, Sula (1973), Song of Solomon (1977), Tar Baby (1981), Beloved (1987), Jazz (1992), Paradise (1998), Love (2003),  A Mercy (2008) Home (2012), and God Bless the Child (2014).  We will screen the 1998 film adaptation of her novel Beloved, along with documentaries related to Morrison such as Gail Pellet and Bill Moyers's Toni Morrison:  A Writer's Work and Gary Deans, Alan Hall and Jana Wendt's Toni Morrison: Uncensored"
ENGL 6530,The Modern Imagination: The Major Authors,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4832, ENGL 4535",,,,"Following my credo, ""Always the text; always historicize,"" The Modern Imagination: Major Authors has been a successful course for relatively advanced undergraduates as well as for Ph.D students and MFAs. It is an indispensable, probing, and pleasurable course for those studying nineteenth, twentieth, and contemporary century Anglophone and European literature. Our readings will include works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Proust, Kafka, Mann, Ferrante, Kundera,and W. G. Sebald as well as the poetry of T.S.Eliot, Yeats, and Steven/s. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, but we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. We shall also be aware of critical and theoretical approaches. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism and as well as Post-Modernism. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture. Within the very broad course rubric, students will be able to select the special topics on which they write essays and perhaps formulate subjects for further study"

ENGL 6912,Michel Foucault: Sovereignty to BioPolitics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 6212, GOVT 6215",,,,"This course will explore the ways in which Michel Foucault's oeuvre transitions from a concern with sovereignty to a preoccupation with biopolitics. Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

Students will leverage archival materials at Cornell to launch new observations and explore unanticipated approaches to urban culture that derive from previously understudied archival materials. The goal is twofold: to demystify the representational technologies involved in presenting the city, and to unpack the political, cultural, and aesthetic values and priorities embedded in every form of presentation.

This colloquium will bring together scholars working at the forefront of legal history, law and literature, law and culture, and critical theory from the institutional vantage points of both law and the humanities. This year, the colloquium will focus on the topic of ""law and justice."" The course will begin with three weeks of seminar designed to apprise students of existing work in law and the humanities and to situate current developments within this broader frame, concentrating on the often complicated relationship between law and justice. We will examine, for example, debates about voting, trial procedure, the prison system, citizenship, and other aspects of democratic process.

Using an interdisciplinary approach (literature, history, anthropology, media, law, and science), we will explore categories such as sexual norms, human rights, power, feminism, queerness, gender/sex, censorship/ moral panic, and identity in Euro-American as well as in postcolonial and global terms. Through a variety of films, primary and secondary sources, you will formulate questions and provide answers to the relationship of these categories with organizing structures, including race, ethnicity, religion, family, marriage, reproduction, the economy, and the state. While we investigate how sexual identities in African, South American, and Asian contexts converge with or challenge Euro-American discourses, we will look at the tools LGBT studies offers for understanding power and culture"

Interest in this ""medicalization of life"" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

This course hunts the dangerous and subversive figure of the vampire across a variety of pages, stages and screens. From campy melodramas and raucous stage comedies, to lush cinematic epics and politically savvy television---and all the Draculas that have come and gone in between--we will explore how the vampire changes with medium, period, and genre. Using a variety of critical approaches we will consider why this most persistent cultural metaphor emerges in particular cultural moments, and what social anxieties and desires it articulates. We will interrogate the vampire's relationship to race and gender and analyze how the vampire is constructed, appropriated, adapted, reinvented, and performed in its many contexts, asking what it means for us to consume these texts"
FGSS 2621,"Gendering Religion, Science and Technology",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2621, STS 2621",(KCM-AS),,,"There are several ""just-so stories"" about science and religion: the world's religions are parallel systems of belief in the supernatural; science has a set method that produces universal truths; and religion and science are in perpetual conflict. This course will challenge these understandings by introducing students to the study of religion, science, and technology, as well as to ways to think about their relationships. To bring these categories down to earth and unsettle engrained scholarly and popular narratives, our approach will be to gender the study of religion, science, and technology. To do so, we will not simply ""add women and stir,"" to borrow a phrase from feminist historians; rather, we will query how gender, sexuality, and embodiment shape the very construction of knowledge itself"

Reading the original scientific papers and related critical texts, we will ask whether we can find measureable physical differences in male and female brains, and what these differences might be. Do men and women solve spatial puzzles differently, as measured physiologically? Do nonhuman animals display sex-specific behaviors mediated by brain structure, and can we extrapolate these findings to human behavior? Why are boys three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as autistic, and is there any connection between the predominantly male phenomenon of autism and other stereotypically male mental traits? Are there physical representations of sexual orientation in the brain, and how are these related to gender identity? And how are scientific studies represented and misrepresented in popular debate?"
FGSS 3376,Digital Asia,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASIAN 3376, ASIAN 6676, FGSS 6676",(CA-AS),(GB),,"New media remain central to ongoing struggles over the constitution of the public sphere in Asia. In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics. Investigating the logics of contemporary digital media in relation to the field of political expression, the course complicates received notions of non-Western political public spheres as illiberal, or lagging behind a stage of political development posited as normative"
FGSS 3520,(Dis)ability Studies: A Brief History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,FREN 3520,(LA-AS),,,"This course will offer an historical overview of responses to bodily and cognitive difference.  What was the status of the monster, the freak, the abnormal, the (dis)abled, and how are all of these concepts related?  How have we moved from isolation and institutionalization towards universal design and accessibility as the dominant concepts relative to (dis)ability?  Why is this shift from focusing on individual difference as a negative attribute to reshaping our architectural and more broadly social constructions important for everyone?  What are our ethical responsibilities towards those we label as ""disabled""?  Authors to be studied include: Ambroise Paré, Emmanuel Levinas, Georges Canguilhem, Michel Foucault, Lennard Davis, Tobin Siebers, Simon Baron-Cohen"

Some of the questions that will be explored during the semester are: How do ethnicity and femininity intersect? How are authenticity and difference commodified? How do women construct identities through narrative or craft themselves through body modification? How do women negotiate their relationships to their bodies, families and nations? Contemporary television programs, global fashion and cultural studies will also be discussed. Students will write self-narratives about their relationships with cultural standards of beauty"

FGSS 4000,"Senior Seminar in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies",4,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"For Spring 2018, this course will focus on The Complexities of Consent.  The issue of consent is central to much feminism scholarship, yet its meaning is contested. It figures prominently in relation to sex as well as to other issues, such as informed consent to medical procedures, children's rights, surrogacy, and (alienated) labor. Consent occurs (or doesn't) within structures of power; can one consent within conditions that are not, so to speak, of one's own making? What about subjects, such as children, who do not use the ""rational"" language of consent? We draw from legal theory, science studies, and philosophy. How does consent differ from agency? Autonomy? Freedom? We consider case studies that speak to how consent is defined differently across cultures. Under what conditions is consent possible? What alternatives might we envision?"

This course will examine how intersectional disability experiences, in particular, impact and are impacted by access to employment, education, and health care. We will explore the efficacy of legal and policy initiatives that are already in place, and in doing so, strongly consider the growing need for, and value of, intersectional approaches to disability discrimination"

The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

In high measure, censorship affects the Internet and visual media (including digital, independent cinema), and government agencies are particularly wary of the viral qualities of new media. Extensive state investment into Internet control is offset by the fact that the Internet remains a primary site of political dissent and organizing. New media and communications technologies further continue to engender novel forms of political expression and notions of collectivity. In the past few years activists and artists as well as mass publics have thus forged distinct modes of expression in and around new media that, while frequently evading state prohibition, nevertheless present incisive political critique. The course will examine features unique to digital media—such as the viral, mimetic, archival, and amplificatory properties of the Internet—and ask how politicized media make use of these features to intervene into contexts of censorship and occlusion. We will draw on Asian media contexts also to interrogate assumptions about progressive politics.

At the same time, the success of many writers like Nerval, Maupassant, Proust, Gide, ad Leduc, among others, began to legitimize first person narratives that blurred the boundaries between fiction and autobiography, narrator and author, madness and creativity. Finally, in the twentieth century, in the wake of antipsychiatry, for many patients and survivors, these accounts of their own experience of madness became acts of resistance, a way to achieve their own recovery and emancipatory journey.

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"

This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

Emphasis is on how to make meaningful comparisons between systems in different countries. Towards that goal, we will be looking at a dozen countries with different histories, political systems, and from various regions around the world.  We will also use a comparative framework to use our knowledge of these (and other) countries to examine questions about democracies and democratization, electoral systems and political parties, authoritarian regimes, political mobilization and change, economic development and globalization, nationalism and identity politics, among other topics.  The meta theme of this course is the comparative method as a unique way of leveraging our understanding about social and political phenomena"

GOVT 2041,Electoral (mal)practice,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"Factors ranging from the difficulty of registration and costs of voter ID, the purging of voter rolls, a bungled election featuring mis-marked butterfly ballots, concerns about foreign influence or even hacking, continued gerrymandering at the state and federal levels, and several recent Condorcet failures, lead many to question the integrity of U.S. electoral institutions and administration. How can flawed elections be detected and improved? What are the causes of declining perceptions of democracy in the U.S. and elsewhere? How does system support affect government stability and performance in a democracy? We address these questions using both U.S. state-level and cross-national evidence. Students learn how to read and conduct evidence-based social scientific research, and how to act as an effective research consultant. We touch on the emerging field of election forensics and its application to U.S. data and to recent disputes in Kenya, Armenia, and Turkey, among other high-profile cases"

It has provided the soundtrack to political protest and been the object of political censorship; politicians have courted pop stars and pop stars — like Bono of U2 — have acted as politicians. This class will therefore examine the various interaction between popular music and politics, and how popular music can contribute to our understanding of political thought and action, but also critically reflect upon the effects of popular music on people's political perceptions, attitudes and behavior"

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista"

The aim of this course is to equip students with the conceptual tools necessary to understand these processes. We will begin with a review of popular approaches to studying policy and then move on to explore the various stages of policy development: agenda-setting, policy design, policy implementation, policy feedback and policy change. We will consider the roles played by both institutions (congress, the bureaucracy and interests groups) and everyday people. Finally, we will closely study several specific policy arenas (a few likely candidates include: education policy, health policy, social welfare policy and housing policy). As we engage all of these ideas, students will be consistently challenged to grapple with the paradoxes of policy making in a democratic polity and to envision pathways for substantive political change.   "

This focus has led to major adjustments in US priorities in Africa, including the pairing of diplomacy, defense, and development into new forms of cooperation and intervention. One of the framework for the new approach is the Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) under which the US has associated ten African countries in its global fight against terrorism. The TSCTP is predicated on the idea that significant areas of Africa, peopled as they are by weak states, could become a safe haven for terrorist groups linked with al-Qaeda, the Salafists, and other radical Islamic groups including ISIL today. This course explores the operations of the TSCTP and points of friction between the US and the populations of the zone of implementation. We will place special emphasis on African suspicions of some key tenets of the war on terrorism and skepticism of the methods adopted in the war on terrorism. Key among these are the principle of securing the primary of counterterrorism and the necessary institutional frictions that arise when considering development and good governance"

This course examines what the Frankfurt School knew by introducing students to Critical Theory, beginning with its roots in the 19th century (i.e., Kant, Hegel, Marx, and Nietzsche) and then focusing on its most prominent manifestation in the 20th century, the Frankfurt School (e.g., Kracauer, Adorno, Benjamin, Horkheimer, Marcuse), particularly in its engagement with politics, society, culture, and literature (e.g. Brecht, Kafka, and Beckett).  Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European social, political, and aesthetic theory: from analyses of authoritarianism and democracy to commentaries on the entertainment industry, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to Critical Theory explores both the prescience of these diverse thinkers for today's world (""what they knew"") as well as what they perhaps could not anticipate in the 21st century (e.g., developments in technology, economy, political orders), and thus how to critically address these changes today"

How is the work of governance carried out in the United States? What kinds of institutional arrangements are employed, and how have they developed? What are the consequences for governance? Answering these questions immerses us in the study of American political development to assess the evolution, character, and scope of the administrative state and of other arrangements-typically channeled through the private sector-through which the nation implements public policies. In the processes, the course grapples with analytical questions about processes of political change and considers a variety of theoretical approaches. Variants of ""new institutionalism"" will be highlighted, as well as reflections on the puzzles of American exceptionalism. The body of the course will investigate such topics as the development of public bureaucracy, the emergence of the civil service, and the evolution of the regulatory state and the welfare state.

We derive the Ordinary Least Squares estimator and its characteristics using matrix algebra and determine the conditions under which it achieves statistical optimality. We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference.

GOVT 6215,Michel Foucault: Sovereignty to BioPolitics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 6212, ENGL 6912",,,,"This course will explore the ways in which Michel Foucault's oeuvre transitions from a concern with sovereignty to a preoccupation with biopolitics. Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

HIST 2660,Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIIS 2660, AMST 2660",(HA-AS),(HB),,"One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting.

Only a century ago, however, Latin America was predominantly rural, with 80% of the population residing in the region's vast and varied rural areas. How did this dramatic change happen? What had to be built or destroyed, materially and ideologically, to make the continuous growth of cities possible? What were the political and social strategies of recent urban inhabitants and working people to accommodate to and transform the ostensibly frenetic, and often turbulent, process of urban growth? This course will address these questions from a historical perspective, by drawing on historical monographs, anthropological studies, architectural histories, planning proposals, political texts, development reports, and films. We will focus on the social, economic, and political practices that transformed the Latin American urban world, from the ""Europeanized"" cities of the turn of the century to today's megalopolises, as well as on the ideological and theoretical frameworks set up to grasp and, thus, reshape the persistent process of urbanization over the course of the century"

Through the course readings, both primary and secondary, we will analyze how the superstitious was mobilized within struggles between Catholics and Protestants, the nobility and the peasantry, and within emergent Enlightenment philosophy.  In particular we will discuss why witches or werewolves were imagined (and hunted) in the period, what that can tell us about the cultural climate of the time, but also how their meaning could morph into the familiar horror stapes of our own world"

What do the new generation of activists and scholars mean by ""the carceral state?"" Why and when do politicians talk about prisons, how do prisons serve as models or anti-models for political society?

Five centuries have not diminished either the overwhelming importance or the strangeness of the early encounter between Europeans and the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Taking a comparative approach, this course will conceptualize early American history as the product of reciprocal cultural encounters by assessing the various experiences of Spanish, French, and English newcomers in different regions of the Americas. Critical interpretation of primary source material will be emphasized in the course, as will the development of students' ability to reflect critically on these documents, taking into account the perspective of both the colonizers and the colonized. "

Particular case studies will be addressed stemming from the faculty's specializations (for example, Vietnam, Cambodia, Guatemala, and Chile) and the emphasis is on the role of the United States in Latin America and Southeast Asia. Prominent themes will include forms of subversion, from military muscle to economic coercion, and how and why they have changed over time; meanings of liberty, democracy, freedom, and sovereignty in different places and times; popular responses to policies and actions of foreign administrations; the relationships between sovereign states and transnational corporations; the uses and abuses of History in the formulation and justification of policy initiatives and in local responses to them; and the complexities involved in discerning internal and external forces in an increasingly transnational world"

In the first section, we analyze the difficulties that 16th-century theologians experienced in determining if the ""Indian"" possessed a soul and if the Spanish crown could wage a ""just war"" against indigenous ""pagans"": this debate was crucial for the New World origins of disciples such as anthropology and international relations. In the second section, we examine the Haitian Revolution in order to describe and interrogate the philosophical and historical relations between master and slave. In the third section, we look at writings such as the Communist manifesto and Che Guevara' essays in order to analyze the difficulties of articulating the relationship between man and socialism in Cuba. In the final section, we examine the problems of designating who constitutes the native ""we"" and the foreign ""them"" in the neoliberal economic revolution that is taking place in Jamaica; for this discussion, we will read Jamaica Kincaid's A Small Place and view Stephanie Black's film, Life and Debt"
LATA 3015,Sweetness: How Sugar Built the Modern World,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 3010,(HA-AS),(GHB),,"Rice, wheat, and maize are examples of crops that sustained the civilizations in which they were cultivated for centuries. Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen"

This means that one cannot lay claim to a sufficient mastery of Latin qua language until one has acquired some oral skills. At the same time, unlike a modern language, the goal of spoken Latin is not conversational fluency. Rather, by formulating one's own thoughts into Latin and expressing them in real human-to-human interaction allows one to experience the unique structural, grammatical, and syntactical features of the language actively and not just passively. This will in turn enhance reading comprehension. Thus this course will always draw inspiration from real authors and real texts, including Plautus, Cicero, Jerome, Erasmus, and many others"

How does the legal profession's monopoly on the right to give legal advice shape the justice system? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal materials as well as work by legal academics. Students will take several smaller exams to test their mastery of central ethical rules governing the conduct of lawyers, and complete short writing assignments on topics discussed in class"

LAW 6822,Social Science and the Law,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course examines the relationship of social science to law, focusing on the growing use of social science in the legal system. Over the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have conducted systematic research on the operation of law and legal institutions. At the same time, social scientists themselves are testifying as experts in increasing numbers, encouraging lawyers and judges at both the trial and appellate levels to rely on social science evidence to decide cases. Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation. Are social scientists asking the right questions? Are lawyers, judges, legislators, and legal reformers using social science findings appropriately? Is the law's increasing reliance on social science problematic or advantageous -- or both?"

This course will examine the powers of and legal restraints on state and local governments in state systems, and as a part of the American constitutional order. Topics will include state constitutions, the rights that they confer, and their methods of interpretation; local government boundary formation and boundary change; state and local service, police, and taxing powers; the emergence of supra-local (regional) government; and the place of state and local governments in the federal system (including commerce clause, privileges and immunities clause, and taxation issues). The final part of the course will consider several areas of recent and future litigation - such as the interstate validity of gay marriages and federal challenges to states' medical and health reforms - as a way to illustrate the difficult issues of conflicting sovereignty that this area of law presents"

Drawing on performance studies, it considers the textuality of musical events and weighs the particular challenges, possibilities, and limitations of writing ethnographically about sound, music, and movement. In doing so, it explores the temporality and spatiality of ethnographic writing, engages related critiques of the so-called ethnographic present, and considers issues of representation and subjectivity. Students will approach these questions through critical readings in anthropology and ethnomusicology as well as through weekly workshopping of their own writing"

NBA 5140,Ethics and Corporate Culture,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"In the high-pressure worlds of business and law, all too often good people do bad things.  In many cases, the unethical behavior is due in part to a toxic corporate culture. The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where ""only results matter,"" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior.

NBA 5200,Retail Operations,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"This course is designed as a half-semester elective course for MBA students.

It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures"

NBA 5770,Entrepreneurship in Creative Industries,1.5,Opt NoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"The venture capitalist Arthur Rock once said, ""I prefer to invest in companies that change the way we live and think."" This course is focused on strategies for creating and growing such companies: entrepreneurial leaders in the creative industries. Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success.

NBAY 6030,Big Data in Marketing,1,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"This course is concerned with the new institutions that support marketing. The study of these institutions is important for several reasons. First, marketing managers need to decide who to partner with, and typically that means that they have to assemble what the industry calls a ""stack"" of marketing technology and advertising technology partners and suppliers. Second, the entrepreneurs who build these institutions need to know how they fit together in an ecosystem, how they collaborate and how they compete. Third there is a tension between the largest of these institutions, platforms like Google, Amazon, and Facebook, that offer themselves as fully integrated systems for the practice of data-driven marketing, and the rest of the institutional space, which contains large specialized firms such as Salesforce.com and smaller niche specialists. Marketers and investors should have a point of view on whether, or to what extent, the future lies with the giants of big data, sometimes called walled gardens, or the more open system of data flows among the niches.  In sum, the goal of the course is to introduce the institutions within which students of today will make their careers.

Napoleon's journey, however, signalled far more than the beginning of a military exercise: over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Muslims throughout the Middle East and South Asia came to engage with the ideas, technologies, and political power of Europe in unprecedented ways that deeply shaped the path of Islamic history. This course, in turn, explores these shifts over the past two centuries. It is designed to introduce students not only to the leading ideas and movements among Muslims over the past two hundred years, but also to how these ideas have shaped the lives of Muslims living in Muslim-majority countries and Muslim-minority countries alike. It will push students to consider how Islam has changed over the past two centuries and how these changes are similar to and different from the transformations that have emerged in other religious traditions. Topics will include: Gender and Modesty; Prayer and Ritual; Ethics; Constitutionalism; Sufism; and Modern Islamic Movements. Through these topics, students will examine the diverse contexts in which and methods by which Muslims have interpreted their foundational texts, and more generally, their often-competing understandings of Islam what it means to be a Muslim"

The second part of the course will be devoted to discussing the ways in which contemporary discourses such as a ""clash of civilizations,"" ""the Evil Empire,"" ""The Great Satan,"" and the ""Axis of Evil"" draw upon these respective cultural histories and explicitly or implicitly positing political conflict as a ""battle for God."""

Structured as a seminar, this course takes you on a journey through Southeast Asia, home to almost a quarter of the global Muslim population, to explore how centuries of cultural mixing and layering have shaped the regions' religious outlook. How are local traditions and universal Islamic precepts reconciled? How is this manifested in the performative arts and rituals? How does Islam play out in governance and the law? How is Islam deployed in the transnational sphere? Previous knowledge of Islam is an advantage, but not a requisite to succeed in this course.

The course explores major themes and periods in Iran's transition from the secular state of the Pahlavi dynasty to the religious state of the Islamic Republic in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will focus on social as well as political themes including the Anglo-Russo-American Occupation of Iran, the 1979 Islamic Revolution, U.S.-Iranian relations, Iraq-Iran War, the Green Movement and the crisis of Islamic government, Images of the West in Iran, Modern Youth Culture, Gender segregation, and the struggle between modernity and traditionalism in contemporary Iran. We will watch selected Iranian documentary and feature films and draw on modern Persian literature but will approach them not as art forms but as reflections of major socio-economic, political, and religious phenomena in Iran's modern history. We will read and watch what the Iranians wrote and produced, read and watched, in order to view and explain Iran and its relations with the West through the Iranian eyes. We will examine how the Iranians perceived themselves and the others, how they viewed their own governments and the West, what issues inspired and shaped their outlook outside the official censorship during the period in question. All readings are in English translation and the films are with English subtitles. The course includes lectures deconstructing political, religious, and social evolution of modern Iran as well as regular class discussions where we will address the issues in question from a variety of perspectives"

We will focus our attention on commercial centers that fostered inter-communal relations, as well as investigating sites of strife and cases of minority repression. We will read histories, memoirs, and fiction, and view films that help us better understand inter-communal relations, tensions, and conflict. We will also interrogate the terms for exploring a range distinctions among majority and minority populations including: religious difference (Muslims, Christians, and Jews); divisions of religious rite (Sunni and Shi'a); entho-linguistic minorities (Armenians and Kurds); national identities (Israelis and Palestinians); cultures of origin (Mizrahi, Sephardi, and Ashkenazi Jews).

This focus has led to major adjustments in US priorities in Africa, including the pairing of diplomacy, defense, and development into new forms of cooperation and intervention. One of the framework for the new approach is the Trans Sahara Counter Terrorism Partnership (TSCTP) under which the US has associated ten African countries in its global fight against terrorism. The TSCTP is predicated on the idea that significant areas of Africa, peopled as they are by weak states, could become a safe haven for terrorist groups linked with al-Qaeda, the Salafists, and other radical Islamic groups including ISIL today. This course explores the operations of the TSCTP and points of friction between the US and the populations of the zone of implementation. We will place special emphasis on African suspicions of some key tenets of the war on terrorism and skepticism of the methods adopted in the war on terrorism. Key among these are the principle of securing the primary of counterterrorism and the necessary institutional frictions that arise when considering development and good governance"

It is a region long anchored to tropes of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. It is also a place in which liminality, betwixt and between Europe and Asia, endures as both a perceived geographic imaginary and an experienced condition in the detritus of imperialisms past. The Caucasus's extraordinary diversity in languages and ethnicities has generated a deep suspicion of it by those surrounding the region, and has sparked profound social tragedies. But it has also stimulated a curiosity that has generated meditations on culture, identity, and social life. This course explores the Caucasus through its archaeology, anthropology, history, literature, music, and film. We will examine the entanglement of the region's history with its internal and external representations in order to get a sense of the array of forces shaping the Caucasus today"

It covers the main topics and questions regarding bodies, diseases, and medical institutions within the framework of major historical developments in world and region's history. The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

Yet, in an unexpected turn, the 1970s saw religious revival swept across the globe as societies from the Middle East to Latin America to the United States turned to their divine texts. In the four decades since, religious movements across the world have gained increasingly prominent positions in society and government. How do these mass movements happen? What exactly is the relation between specific revivals, their holy texts and the societies in which they arise? How do they affect politics? Are contemporary religious revivals broadly similar or do they contain geographical or religious particularities? In this seminar, we will begin to examine these questions through the prism of social movement theory, covering the Islamic Revival in Egypt, Religious Zionism in Israel, the rise of Liberation Theology in Latin America and the ""Moral Majority"" in the United States.  Drawing on texts, audio recordings, and video, we will explore how and why men and women turned to religion since the 1970s and how the practices of individual believers have shaped the relationship between religion and politics globally. Courses in varied religious traditions would be helpful, but are not a requirement, to succeed in this seminar"

We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today"

It is a region long anchored to tropes of disobedience, punishment, and redemption. It is also a place in which liminality, betwixt and between Europe and Asia, endures as both a perceived geographic imaginary and an experienced condition in the detritus of imperialisms past. The Caucasus's extraordinary diversity in languages and ethnicities has generated a deep suspicion of it by those surrounding the region, and has sparked profound social tragedies. But it has also stimulated a curiosity that has generated meditations on culture, identity, and social life. This course explores the Caucasus through its archaeology, anthropology, history, literature, music, and film. We will examine the entanglement of the region's history with its internal and external representations in order to get a sense of the array of forces shaping the Caucasus today"

Yet, in an unexpected turn, the 1970s saw religious revival swept across the globe as societies from the Middle East to Latin America to the United States turned to their divine texts. In the four decades since, religious movements across the world have gained increasingly prominent positions in society and government. How do these mass movements happen? What exactly is the relation between specific revivals, their holy texts and the societies in which they arise? How do they affect politics? Are contemporary religious revivals broadly similar or do they contain geographical or religious particularities? In this seminar, we will begin to examine these questions through the prism of social movement theory, covering the Islamic Revival in Egypt, Religious Zionism in Israel, the rise of Liberation Theology in Latin America and the ""Moral Majority"" in the United States.  Drawing on texts, audio recordings, and video, we will explore how and why men and women turned to religion since the 1970s and how the practices of individual believers have shaped the relationship between religion and politics globally. Courses in varied religious traditions would be helpful, but are not a requirement, to succeed in this seminar"

It covers the main topics and questions regarding bodies, diseases, and medical institutions within the framework of major historical developments in world and region's history. The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

We will review Benjamin's life and some of the key disputes over his heritage; read some of the best-known of his essays; and devote significant time to his enigmatic and enormously rich masterwork, the Arcades Project, concluding with consideration of the relevance of Benjamin's insights for cultural and political dilemmas today"

The first half of the course will focus on various first-order ethical theories, which offer criteria of morally right action. These will include consequentialist and deontological approaches, and also broadly virtue-theoretic approaches, which place more emphasis on the notion of moral character and/or are critical of focusing exclusively on what one ought to do as opposed to who one ought to be. The second half of the course will examine some of the more abstract questions about the nature of morality which are the province of twentieth-century metaethics. What is the nature of moral properties? Where in the world might they be located? Are they objective, subjective, and/or relative to particular times and places? What is the connection between morality, moral judgments, and being motivated to act morally? Interspersed with these theoretical ethical issues will be more concrete ethical questions about what to do as individuals in an often unjust social world"

This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans.

Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"
PHIL 2465,Philosophy of Applied Jurisprudence,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"This course examines a series of epistemic and metaphysical issues raised in modern applied jurisprudence. For example: What constitutes an actionable 'harm' and how can successful plaintiffs be 'made whole?' What kinds of evidence should juries consider in their deliberations, and how should they be guided in so doing? How does more or less speculative evidence from modern neuroscience complicate questions of culpability and mens rea? How do we justify punishment generally, and incarceration specifically? Does it make sense for juries to apply the 'reasonable person' standard in sexual harassment cases if we cannot conceive of a genderless person? We will examine these and other questions, applying philosophical rigor to modern jurisprudence"

RELST 2277,Meditation in Indian Culture,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASIAN 2277,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This course probes the truths behind traditional claims of the priority of internal practice in Indian traditions. We will examine both practices themselves - techniques of meditation and contemplation - religious ways of using intellect, forms of chant and ritual, and the dynamics through which these have left a wider mark on South Asian civilization. These dynamics include not only the evident reverberations of practice in philosophical reflection and socioreligious institutions, but also wide-ranging processes of stylization, elaboration, and popularization found throughout South Asian culture. In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts. To keep the interaction between internal practice and broader world views central, we will examine both Hindu and Buddhist sources, consistently examining the ways in which similar practices are given distinct shapes by the two religious traditions"

Napoleon's journey, however, signalled far more than the beginning of a military exercise: over the course of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, Muslims throughout the Middle East and South Asia came to engage with the ideas, technologies, and political power of Europe in unprecedented ways that deeply shaped the path of Islamic history. This course, in turn, explores these shifts over the past two centuries. It is designed to introduce students not only to the leading ideas and movements among Muslims over the past two hundred years, but also to how these ideas have shaped the lives of Muslims living in Muslim-majority countries and Muslim-minority countries alike. It will push students to consider how Islam has changed over the past two centuries and how these changes are similar to and different from the transformations that have emerged in other religious traditions. Topics will include: Gender and Modesty; Prayer and Ritual; Ethics; Constitutionalism; Sufism; and Modern Islamic Movements. Through these topics, students will examine the diverse contexts in which and methods by which Muslims have interpreted their foundational texts, and more generally, their often-competing understandings of Islam what it means to be a Muslim"

The first part of this course will examine the origins of the concept of holy war, crusade and jihad and trace their cultural histories. The second part of the course will be devoted to discussing the ways in which contemporary discourses such as a ""clash of civilizations,"" ""the Evil Empire,"" ""The Great Satan,"" and the ""Axis of Evil"" draw upon these respective cultural histories and explicitly or implicitly positing political conflict as a ""battle for God."""

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

Yet, in an unexpected turn, the 1970s saw religious revival swept across the globe as societies from the Middle East to Latin America to the United States turned to their divine texts. In the four decades since, religious movements across the world have gained increasingly prominent positions in society and government. How do these mass movements happen? What exactly is the relation between specific revivals, their holy texts and the societies in which they arise? How do they affect politics? Are contemporary religious revivals broadly similar or do they contain geographical or religious particularities? In this seminar, we will begin to examine these questions through the prism of social movement theory, covering the Islamic Revival in Egypt, Religious Zionism in Israel, the rise of Liberation Theology in Latin America and the ""Moral Majority"" in the United States.  Drawing on texts, audio recordings, and video, we will explore how and why men and women turned to religion since the 1970s and how the practices of individual believers have shaped the relationship between religion and politics globally. Courses in varied religious traditions would be helpful, but are not a requirement, to succeed in this seminar"

The possibilities of editing (via the cut, the loop, or the overdub) on one hand, and the seeming capacity for indiscriminate recording of sound on the other, revealed tape to be a medium with claims both for authentic documentation (and also surveillance), and wide aesthetic reference (but also mass deception). With one ear to the state and another to the music industry, this course will focus on the way politics and the arts responded to and incorporated the new technology. Authors include Andy Warhol, Alvin Lucier, Hunter S. Thompson, William S. Burroughs, The Last Poets, The Firesign Theatre, The Credibility Gap, Adrian Piper"
SHUM 4620,Undocumentation,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4620, COML 4616, FGSS 4620, LATA 4620, LSP 4621, ROMS 4625, VISST 4620",,,,"In this seminar we will sustain a particular reading of post-1984 Mexico-US border cultural production as ""undocumentation."" Specifically, we will focus on performance, conceptual, and cinematic practices that corrupt the spreadsheet and the exposé; that reflect their makers' commitments to portraying extreme labor situations in a period of greater Mexican neoliberal transition now synonymous with NAFTA, culture and drug wars, and border militarization and maquilization. Assigned texts will include artwork by the Border Art Workshop and Elizabeth Sisco, Louis Hock, and David Avalos; writing by Gloria Anzaldúa, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Sara Uribe, and Sergio González Rodríguez; contributions to the Tijuana-San Diego installation festival inSITE; and ""undocumentaries"" like Alex Rivera's Borders Trilogy, Sergio De La Torre and Vicki Funari's Maquilapolis, and Natalia Almada's El Velador"
SHUM 4621,Joyce and the Graveyard of Digital Empires,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 4997,,,,"A survey of digital media scholarship from 1970 to 2000 that takes as its focal point Joyce's 1922 novel, Ulysses—one of the most influential literary works of the 20th century—this seminar investigates major theories of media and literature in relation to the emergence of electronic media technologies. Drawing upon critical theory, media history, and specific artistic and scholarly projects in old and new media, the course asks how and why Joyce came to be used as a defining figure of the ""golden age"" of hypertext theory: both an exemplary artist and an ultimate editorial challenge. Of special interest to the course is the fate of scholarly projects that took Joyce as their subject, for the challenges of sustainability that the first wave of digital scholarly projects encountered—challenges that reflect on more general problems of preservation in the digital environment, like data corruption, memory failures, and link rot—give rise to important questions about loss, failure, and memory in the history of the digital humanities. Themes that the course explores include hypertext theory, poststructuralist theory, electronic scholarly projects, histories of computing, histories of the book, concepts of the ""social text,"" and the history of predictions about the fate of traditional written forms in an electronic world. Authors and works include James Joyce, Marshall McLuhan, Roland Barthes, Jacques Derrida, George Landow, Jay David Bolter, Hans Walter Gabler, Michael Groden, Jerome McGann, and interactive digital texts"
SHUM 4622,Thinking Through Transparency,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 4618,,,,"The course reads theoretical texts on liberalism, neoliberalism, and corruption in dialogue with science fiction/fantasy narratives, literary and visual. We will study how the aesthetic features of these genres are used to thematize corruption and scandal, and to imagine various forms of transparency, both interpersonal and political. Our goal is to understand how accounts of transparency and corruption in speculative fiction can engage the constitutive categories of liberal political thought, such as freedom, rights, property, progress, autonomy, and legality. Students are advised to read the Song of Ice and Fire series or watch Game of Thrones before class begins. In the last section, students will be asked to select a cultural text for their presentation, and assign part of it as a course reading"

This course will examine the origins of modern imperialism through the lens of corruption, exploring how corruption scandals became sites for generating new ideas and practices of empire. As well as reading prominent figures of the European enlightenment, including Adam Smith, Edmund Burke, and Denis Diderot, we will also study major Indian writers on corruption, including the historian Ghulam Husain, and the liberal reformer, Ram Mohan Roy. Students will conduct primary research into eighteenth-century imperial corruption scandals, and consider the larger question of how modern ideas of political reform grew out of early modern theories of corruption"
SHUM 4624,The Politics of Imprisonment,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 4724,,,,"Different polities incarcerate in different ways. This seminar puts prisons into their wider political contexts, considering them as sites for wider debates about rights, tyranny, corruption and slavery, race and empire. Why did the birth of the modern prison coincide so closely with the birth of the American (and French) republics? How did changing forms of imprisonment intersect with imperial ambitions? What do the new generation of activists and scholars mean by ""the carceral state?"" Why and when do politicians talk about prisons, how do prisons serve as models or anti-models for political society? In what sense can we call prisons political institutions, or speak of a ""carceral state?"" Readings cover Europe and the US from the 17th century to the present"

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.  This course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program.

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies.

SOC 3160,Social Context and Health,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course examines how the social world gets ""under the skin."" We'll examine the associations between various aspects of social context – including stratification and inequality, social networks and support, and social environments – and physical health. There are two main components of this course. First, we'll read and discuss previous research on the health effects of social status, patient-physician interactions, employment/work, stress, social networks, social support, loneliness, culture and religion, and the neighborhood context.

We come together to revere, conserve, protect the things many call nature. We struggle over who gets to use what, which resources to use or to keep intact, which scientific claims are true and worthy of action. Every environmental concern is on some level a social concern, and more social concerns than we often realize are environmental concerns. In this course, we will examine how people make and respond to environmental change and how groups of people form, express, fight over, and work out environmental concerns. We will consider how population change, economic activity, government action, social movements, and changing ways of thinking shape human-environmental relationships.

It is designed for first-year graduate students in sociology. The course covers intermediate topics in linear regression, and provides an introduction to models for categorical and count data, the analysis of time data, and longitudinal data. We'll also discuss data-related issues such as missing data and weighting, and data that are complicated by issues of non-random design. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice"

SOC 6350,Network Sampling and Network Structure,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Network sampling methods provide means for drawing probability samples of hidden and hard-to-reach populations. These populations are difficult to sample using standard survey research methods because they lack a sampling frame, that is, an exhaustive list of population members from which the sample can be drawn and constructing a sampling frame is not feasible due to the closed nature of the populations networks or associated factors. Populations with these characteristics are important to studies of public health (e.g., drug users and commercial sex workers), public policy (e.g., immigrants and the homeless), and arts and culture (e.g., jazz musicians and aging artists). This course will survey the use of network-based approaches to sample populations and study the structure of social networks. The focus will range from initial work on biased network theory, through various approaches based on snowball sampling, the ""random-walk"" approach, adaptive sampling, and link-tracing designs, to a principal focus on respondent-driven sampling (RDS), including the analytics underlying that method, operational procedures, recent work extending the method, the potential for use of RDS to study the structure of very large social networks, and open areas in which further work is continuing and alternative formulations are emerging"

In the second section, we examine the Haitian Revolution in order to describe and interrogate the philosophical and historical relations between master and slave. In the third section, we look at writings such as the Communist manifesto and Che Guevara' essays in order to analyze the difficulties of articulating the relationship between man and socialism in Cuba.

We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise.

To bring these categories down to earth and unsettle engrained scholarly and popular narratives, our approach will be to gender the study of religion, science, and technology.

Every environmental concern is on some level a social concern, and more social concerns than we often realize are environmental concerns. In this course, we will examine how people make and respond to environmental change and how groups of people form, express, fight over, and work out environmental concerns. We will consider how population change, economic activity, government action, social movements, and changing ways of thinking shape human-environmental relationships.

STS 4101,The Entangled Lives of Humans and Animals,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ANTHR 4101, BSOC 4101",(KCM-AS),,,"One animal behaviorist speculates that big brains develop when species are social; that is, when they must read cues from members of their group to understand when to approach, when to flee, when to fight, when to care. This course looks not only at animals in their social lives, but also at animals in their lives with us. We ask questions about how species become entangled and what that means for both parties, about the social lives of animals independently and with humans, about the survival of human and animal species, and about what it means to use animals for science, food, and profit. The course draws on readings from Anthropology, Science & Technology Studies, and animal trainers and behaviorists"
