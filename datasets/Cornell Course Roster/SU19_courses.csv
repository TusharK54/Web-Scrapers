This ""American exceptionalism"" -- the turn to mass incarceration -- has been fostered by the use of sharply-delineated categories that define vast numbers of people as outlaws and others as law-abiding.

ANTHR 3305,Anthropology of Parenting,4,Stdnt Opt,Summer,,,,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"Human children are packets of genes that represent individual reproductive success. Like all animals, humans are selected by evolution to care for their offspring, but human infants and children require more intense parental investment than the offspring of most other species. Why is this so? Human parents are also influenced by cultural belief systems and ideology that play out in parenting styles. How do various belief systems influence parent-offspring interaction? In this course we will examine the human infant as a biologically designed organism that has co-evolved with caretakers, and then look at the various parenting styles across cultures that also mold our young"

We will work to understand what he and the ancients knew about the night sky, and the ingenious methods by which they came to know it, and trace the history of astronomy through the modern day. Indeed, modern astronomy abounds with strange alien worlds and exotic events that would have amazed that great classical thinker: Stars and the tantalizing planets that journey with them through the galaxies, which smash into one another over millions of years. And when they die in great explosions, stars create exotic pulsars, black holes, nebulae, and people. And somehow all of this started at the single moment of the Big Bang.

This is especially critical in developing countries where rural and urban people are experiencing rapid transformation – and stark choices.

Philosophers and poets for a few thousand years have contemplated the close kinship between madness and genius and have engaged in lively discussions about changing definitions of creativity as either ingenuity, inspiration, or insanity; as stemming from divine possession, originality, or fanatic enthusiasm. By reading philosophical and medical treatises, by examining texts of fiction and lyric poetry, as well as by including historical accounts, this course will find out when and why our culture decided to call a madman a genius and a genius mad. We shall trace the history of social and artistic transgression and analyze when and why a culture considers great talent as ""too different,"" as ""pathological,"" or as ""un-normal."" You shall read texts ranging from Antiquity to the 18th and 20th centuries and encounter authors from Germany, France, Britain, and the United States.
