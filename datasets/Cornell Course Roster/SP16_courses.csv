Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting.

AMST 2660,Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIS 2660, HIST 2660",(HA-AS),(HB),,"One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills"

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time.

This ""American exceptionalism"" -- the turn to mass incarceration -- has been fostered by the use of sharply-delineated categories that define vast numbers of people as outlaws and others as law-abiding. These categories that are based on ideas of personal responsibility and assumptions about race are modified somewhat by a liberal commitment to human rights.   Our purpose in this course is to understand how such ideas have taken root and to locate the consequences of these ideas for policy and practice. "

We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement"

What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

This failure is due to the inability of national policy to imagine a world beyond a boundary drawn by the formative capitalist ideas of property, production, and profit. The course will begin by discussing the historical origin and continuing force of these ideas while raising questions about their limits. It will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance. The alternatives we will query come from a range of Indigenous writers of fiction, poetry, and theory, who locate themselves in Native American (north and south), Aboriginal, and Maori communities"

In doing so we will focus primarily on literature and film but will also range into the fields of anthropology, sociology, and history. Some questions under discussion: How do factors such as gender, class, race, and religion shape the foods we eat and the circumstances in which we eat them? How do writers use the language of food to explore issues such as gender, sexuality, class, and race?"

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

As a result, archaeology has long looked to the region for explanations of origins, particularly the origins of states and civilization. This introductory course offers an analytical survey of approximately 10,000 years of human history in the Near East, from the appearance of farming villages to the dawn of imperialism, in order to come to terms with the region's distinctive historical trajectory and legacies. Covering modern day Iraq, Turkey, Syria, Iran, and neighboring lands, the focus of this course is on past material worlds, from built spaces and landscapes, to objects and visual media.

ANTHR 2135,"Beyond Kings, Palaces and Temples: Introduction to the Archaeology of South Asia",3,Graded,Spring,,,"ARKEO 2135, ASIAN 2265",(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This course will explore major themes in the archaeology of the South Asian subcontinent from the earliest palaeolithic hunter gatherers to the development of large empires in the mid first millennium CE. South Asia is an extremely diverse geographic and cultural region and we will deal with considerable regional variation: from large states and empires in some areas to foraging groups in others. The course will therefore be organized thematically, alternating between studying broad subcontinent-wide developments and examining illustrative regional case-studies. Some of the themes explored are: the beginnings of agriculture; the growth of complex political systems; and the role of inter-regional interaction. Students will be encouraged to situate the South Asian material within wider theoretical and methodological issues within archaeology and anthropology"
ANTHR 2140,Fantastic Frauds and Myths in Archaeology,3,Graded,Spring,,,ARKEO 2140,(SBA-AS),(GHB),,"Archaeology is the exploration of the human past through the study of material remains made and used by people in the past. However, this field of study has inspired endless theories of ancient aliens, lost civilizations, and dark conspiracies. This course examines these fantastic interpretations of archaeological remains, often popular subjects for television shows, magazine articles, books, and web sites. From the point of view of the archaeologist however these claims are 'pseudoscience'. This course explores this disparity in viewpoints by critically examining specific claims. A careful examination of the evidence and internal logic of these claims will allow us to examine how archaeologists conduct scientific analyses of evidence. The topics covered will include: Who built the mounds in the eastern US? Were there explorers who traveled to the Americas before Columbus? Was Atlantis the source of civilization? Did ancient aliens build the pyramids? Were the sunken cities of India really built by the Gods?"
ANTHR 2201,Early Agriculture,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ARKEO 2201,(HA-AS),(GHB),,"Throughout most of the human career, people survived by hunting and gathering wild foods. The advent of food production is one of the most profound changes in (pre)history. This course examines the current evidence for the appearance and spread of agriculture (plant and animal domestication) around the world. We will consider definitions of agriculture and domestication, the conditions under which it arises, the consequences for those who adopt it, and why it has spread over most of the world"
ANTHR 2285,Egyptomania: Imagining Egypt in the Greco-Roman World,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARKEO 2285, CLASS 2685, NES 2985",(CA-AS),(GHB),,"Throughout Greek and Roman history, the idea of Egypt inspired powerful imaginative responses ranging from fascination to fear. This course investigates Egyptian interactions with the Greco-Roman world and the changing Greek and Roman attitudes towards Egypt. Readings will cover subjects including the earliest Egyptian-Aegean trade, Herodotus' accounts of Egypt, Greco-Macedonian kings on the throne of the pharaohs, Roman perceptions of the notorious Cleopatra, the worship of Egyptian gods in the Greco-Roman world, and the incorporation of Egypt into the Roman empire (among other topics). Through an examination of Greek and Roman representations of Egypt, we will investigate how Greeks and Romans conceived of their own societies and cultural identities. Finally, we will also address images of Egypt in modern popular culture; how have Greco-Roman portrayals of Egypt helped shape today's view of the Pharaonic world?"
ANTHR 2400,Cultural Diversity and Contemporary Issues,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"This course will introduce students to the meaning and significance of forms of cultural diversity for the understanding of contemporary issues. Drawing from films, videos, and selected readings, students will be confronted with different representational forms that portray cultures in various parts of the world, and they will be asked to examine critically their own prejudices as they influence the perception and evaluation of cultural differences. We shall approach cultures holistically, assuming the inseparability of economies, kinship, religion, and politics, as well as interconnections and dependencies between world areas (e.g., Africa, Latin America, the West). Among the issues considered: ""political correctness"" and truth; nativism and ecological diversity; race, ethnicity, and sexuality; sin, religion, and war; global process and cultural integrity"
ANTHR 2450,The Anthropology of Food and Cuisine,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),(GB),,"You are what you eat! This course examines the way food is produced, prepared, exchanged, presented, and given meaning in cultures around the world. It examines the symbolism of specific foodstuffs. Who prepares food and how is it done? Who feeds whom and how these relations are expressed and valued? In addition to looking at these questions we analyze ideas about commensality; how food is used in public contexts for presentation or exchange, and how food is a marker of gender, class, status, ethnicity, and identity. In addition to looking specifically at food, we analyze cultural ideas about gender, the body, and identity in terms of how these cultural patterns are produced and expressed through concrete activities like eating, fasting, and special diets. In this class we stress critical and comparative thinking about subjects we tend to take for granted"
ANTHR 2468,"Medicine, Culture, and Society",3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"BSOC 2468, STS 2468",(CA-AS),,,"Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints. Interest in this ""medicalization of life"" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine"
ANTHR 2472,Engaging Other Cultures: Learning How to Learn About Cultural Differences,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Engaging Other Cultures develops understandings and skills required to live and work in diverse cultural and organizational contexts, abroad and at home.  Learning to deal effectively with linguistic, organizational, and cultural differences opens us up to the creative range of human beings and helps us learn from others in secure, analytical, and self-reflective ways.  The course introduces basic anthropological and linguistic perspectives on cultural and organizational differences, ethnographic fieldwork techniques,  ethnographic writing through ethnographic practice, with some attention to the language learning process.  It is a general education course with particular orientation to those studying abroad and/or working domestically or locally in organizational and cultural contexts new to them"

The course sheds light on structural inequalities that result from the production, circulation, and regulation of drugs, focusing on questions of social justice. Topics include: Bodies on Drugs (pharmaceutical drugs for trans* subjects; the medicalization of gendered bodies; bioscience and race); Drugs and Global Health (global inequities in access to drugs; colonial legacies in drug production and clinical trials); Drugs and Everyday Racism and Sexism (how people's experiences and lifeworlds are shaped by racialized and gendered dimensions of drug use and illegality); and Drugs, Law Enforcement, and Mass Incarceration (how the war on drugs intersects with racism in the US to produce the world's highest incarceration rates, while fostering violence across the globe). Throughout the course, we will examine how human rights and social justice activism shape public debates about drugs; we will also meet with local activist groups. This multi-disciplinary course is grounded in feminist studies, medical anthropology, and critical race theory, and draws on history, political science, legal studies, films, and art"
ANTHR 3026,Inequality and the Global Economy,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"Greece's recent debt crisis has brought into sharp focus the fact that economies are not only interconnected across the globe but that they are embedded in wider social and political relations. How then does one study the global economy? This course explores the historical development of an interconnected, global capitalist economy, focusing not just on Western economies but also their relationship to the non-West. In doing so, it also raises fundamental questions about what we mean by ""economic"" behavior, gifts, money, debt, markets, value, and the creation and persistence of inequality. It provides an introduction to the sub-field of economic anthropology, examining major perspectives within the field (such as substantivist, formalist, Marxist) through the use of case studies"
ANTHR 3045,The Anthropology of Zombies,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"While zombies have existed at some level of reality for centuries, it was not until the 20th Century that zombies overran the global popular imagination.  Because of their origins at the many points of collision between colonizer and colonized, zombies have always walked the uncertain spaces between binary ""certainties"" such as us and them, rich and poor, slave and master, and, of course, alive and dead.  As those spaces of uncertainty have been foreclosed upon through globalization, zombies became symbolically flexible and strategic syntheses across these binaries.  Thus, zombies occupy a variety of liminal spaces wherein contemporary social tensions are reflected and refracted"

Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies"
ANTHR 3230,Humans and Animals,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ANTHR 6230, ARKEO 3230, ARKEO 6230",(CA-AS),(GHB),,"Human-animal relationships are often seen in utilitarian, especially nutritional terms. This is especially true of the analysis of animal remains from archaeological sites. It is clear, however, that animals and meat have significance far beyond their economic value. This course focuses on these non-dietary roles of animals in human societies, past and present. We will explore a broad range of issues to gain a fuller view of human relations to animals. Domestication involves not only the technical process of controlling animal movements and breeding but more crucially requires a fundamental shift in the human perception of animals and their relationship to them. Are pets domestic animals in the same sense as animals that are eaten, or does their owners' relationship with them more closely resemble that of hunters with their prey? Do wild animals mean the same thing to hunter-gatherers and farmers who hunt? We will also consider the importance of animals as wealth, as objects of sacrifice, as totems (metaphors for humans), and as symbols in art. Meat has undeniable dietary value, but the social aspect of consumption is also important. Meat can be used in the context of such behaviors as feasting and meat sharing to create, cement, and manipulate social relationships. In this seminar, we will examine these issues primarily (but not exclusively) in the context of the ethnography and archaeology of the Old World with which the instructor is most familiar, but students are encouraged to offer examples from their own areas of expertise. This course is open to students of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and other disciplines with an interest in human-animal relations"

We will consider the evidence for several possible episodes of interaction as well as the broader issue of how long-distance interaction can be recognized in the archaeological record.  Transoceanic contact is a common element in popular visions of the American past, but most professional archaeologists have rejected the possibility with great vehemence.  The issue provides an interesting case study in the power of orthodoxy in archaeology"

ANTHR 3400,Being and Becoming Black,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3402, ASRC 3400, LSP 3400",(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course is about being Black throughout the Atlantic world. What constitutes Blackness? What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic. Students are urged to choose research topics early in the term from a variety of subjects including music, fashion, religion, literature, politics, sports, etc"

ANTHR 3447,Sport,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),(GB),,"Long overlooked by anthropologists, sport and recreation are increasingly recognized as important windows into culture. Sport can be approached from a number of directions -- interpreted as a ritual; viewed as a spectacle of ethnic, regional, or national identity; seen as a metaphor for life; understood as a major industry. This course will consider these and other approaches to sport, encouraging students to bring their own involvements in sport to reflect not only upon sport itself, but also upon how such reflection can illuminate cultural, psychological, and political dimensions of social life. Why, for example, do we take sport (and other forms of recreation) so seriously? Why do many of us apparently invest more passion in such pursuits than to life's allegedly more serious activities? How is sport integrated into people's identities? Readings will draw from popular literature and media as well as academic writing from a variety of disciplines (psychology, sociology, history) in addition to anthropology"

We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and marginalized female hip hop artists contest sexually exploitative images of women. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? Does hip hop allow a space for alternative femininities? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, minorities in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

How in particular did anticipation of rights bearing European publics, enshrining post Enlightenment values, implicate/disturb the linear narrative of nation states emerging from the ruins of empire? We will explore the temporal entanglements between racialization logics of empire and nation, one demanding difference the other, sameness.  What are the logics and ambivalences of racialization when time of empire requiring difference is also the time of nation, requiring sameness?  What are implications of such an entanglement for postcolonial nations? How do inherited racializations set limits on postcolonial aspirations for homogeneity?  How does postcolonial homogeneity also produce difference in demarcation of the rights bearing subject of the nation?"

The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of ""practice"" follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones.

This is especially true of the analysis of animal remains from archaeological sites. It is clear, however, that animals and meat have significance far beyond their economic value. This course focuses on these non-dietary roles of animals in human societies, past and present. We will explore a broad range of issues to gain a fuller view of human relations to animals. Domestication involves not only the technical process of controlling animal movements and breeding but more crucially requires a fundamental shift in the human perception of animals and their relationship to them. Are pets domestic animals in the same sense as animals that are eaten, or does their owners' relationship with them more closely resemble that of hunters with their prey? Do wild animals mean the same thing to hunter-gatherers and farmers who hunt? We will also consider the importance of animals as wealth, as objects of sacrifice, as totems (metaphors for humans), and as symbols in art. Meat has undeniable dietary value, but the social aspect of consumption is also important. Meat can be used in the context of such behaviors as feasting and meat sharing to create, cement, and manipulate social relationships. In this seminar, we will examine these issues primarily (but not exclusively) in the context of the ethnography and archaeology of the Old World with which the instructor is most familiar, but students are encouraged to offer examples from their own areas of expertise. This course is open to students of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and other disciplines with an interest in human-animal relations"

We will consider the evidence for several possible episodes of interaction as well as the broader issue of how long-distance interaction can be recognized in the archaeological record.  Transoceanic contact is a common element in popular visions of the American past, but most professional archaeologists have rejected the possibility with great vehemence.  The issue provides an interesting case study in the power of orthodoxy in archaeology"

The goal is a thorough and direct knowledge of the Roman and Medieval urban landscape and the way this landscape has sometimes survived until today. Special attention will be given to Roman and Medieval building typology, both private and public, and the development of the urban infrastructure (street system, water supply, fortifications, etc.). Strong emphasis will be placed upon continuity, use/reuse, and transformation of buildings and spaces, etc. Every week one or two different ""regions"" will be explored that are typical for a particular moment of the urban history.

From the point of view of the archaeologist however these claims are 'pseudoscience'. This course explores this disparity in viewpoints by critically examining specific claims. A careful examination of the evidence and internal logic of these claims will allow us to examine how archaeologists conduct scientific analyses of evidence.

This is especially true of the analysis of animal remains from archaeological sites. It is clear, however, that animals and meat have significance far beyond their economic value. This course focuses on these non-dietary roles of animals in human societies, past and present. We will explore a broad range of issues to gain a fuller view of human relations to animals. Domestication involves not only the technical process of controlling animal movements and breeding but more crucially requires a fundamental shift in the human perception of animals and their relationship to them. Are pets domestic animals in the same sense as animals that are eaten, or does their owners' relationship with them more closely resemble that of hunters with their prey? Do wild animals mean the same thing to hunter-gatherers and farmers who hunt? We will also consider the importance of animals as wealth, as objects of sacrifice, as totems (metaphors for humans), and as symbols in art. Meat has undeniable dietary value, but the social aspect of consumption is also important. Meat can be used in the context of such behaviors as feasting and meat sharing to create, cement, and manipulate social relationships. In this seminar, we will examine these issues primarily (but not exclusively) in the context of the ethnography and archaeology of the Old World with which the instructor is most familiar, but students are encouraged to offer examples from their own areas of expertise. This course is open to students of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and other disciplines with an interest in human-animal relations"

We will consider the evidence for several possible episodes of interaction as well as the broader issue of how long-distance interaction can be recognized in the archaeological record.  Transoceanic contact is a common element in popular visions of the American past, but most professional archaeologists have rejected the possibility with great vehemence.  The issue provides an interesting case study in the power of orthodoxy in archaeology"

Strikingly, very few works by these ""Old Masters"" survive in the archaeological record. This course tackles the problems that arise from the gap that exists between famous artists known to us from the ancient textual tradition and the mass of objects that survive by lesser known, often anonymous makers. How useful is literary evidence for traditional art historical practices of attribution and connoisseurship, in the case of antiquity? Is it appropriate to apply the concept of the ""artist"" (rather than ""craftsman"") to ancient material culture? What evidence is there for actual artistic production in the Greek and Roman world, and what can this tell us about ancient artists? Covering the period from Archaic Greece until the early Roman Empire, we will explore the role, status, agency, and identity of the ancient artist across a variety of media, including vase-painting, metal work, marble and bronze sculpture, and engraved gems"

This is especially true of the analysis of animal remains from archaeological sites. It is clear, however, that animals and meat have significance far beyond their economic value. This course focuses on these non-dietary roles of animals in human societies, past and present. We will explore a broad range of issues to gain a fuller view of human relations to animals. Domestication involves not only the technical process of controlling animal movements and breeding but more crucially requires a fundamental shift in the human perception of animals and their relationship to them. Are pets domestic animals in the same sense as animals that are eaten, or does their owners' relationship with them more closely resemble that of hunters with their prey? Do wild animals mean the same thing to hunter-gatherers and farmers who hunt? We will also consider the importance of animals as wealth, as objects of sacrifice, as totems (metaphors for humans), and as symbols in art. Meat has undeniable dietary value, but the social aspect of consumption is also important. Meat can be used in the context of such behaviors as feasting and meat sharing to create, cement, and manipulate social relationships. In this seminar, we will examine these issues primarily (but not exclusively) in the context of the ethnography and archaeology of the Old World with which the instructor is most familiar, but students are encouraged to offer examples from their own areas of expertise. This course is open to students of archaeology, cultural anthropology, and other disciplines with an interest in human-animal relations"

We will consider the evidence for several possible episodes of interaction as well as the broader issue of how long-distance interaction can be recognized in the archaeological record.  Transoceanic contact is a common element in popular visions of the American past, but most professional archaeologists have rejected the possibility with great vehemence.  The issue provides an interesting case study in the power of orthodoxy in archaeology"

Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo.

We begin with politically-charged Montmartre cabarets—Le Chat Noir, Moulin Rouge—where shadow theater, acrobats, and quadrille dancers inspired the street posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlin, and Vallotton. We follow their influence to James Ensor's Ostend carnivals and Les XX (The Twenty), the painters' coalition dedicated to the Belgian Workers Party, and then look at fin-de-siècle print culture through Redon's haunting ""noirs,"" lithographic albums inspired by Poe's tales of horror. We consider the Pont Aven Symbolists' turn from material to dream worlds visualized through stained glass and medieval tapestry; the close ties between Neo-impressionist painters and anarchist art critics; the Nabis (Prophets) pre-cinematic crowd scenes and the Lumière Brothers; and why the Nabis Vuillard and Bonnard abandoned their easels for costume and set design at the Théâtre d'Art. We consider the 1889 exposition universelle and the pavilions that fueled mass colonial fantasies and Gauguin's departure for Tahiti. Woven throughout are larger performances of decadence, crowds, and hysteria as modernity, and tensions between industrial life and utopic longing that led Symbolists to read Monet's Giverny grainstacks series as cosmic orbs, ""the terrestrial life of the globe and the course of earth through space."" We will see the epoch illumined by marvel—electric lighting, phantasmagoria, Jules Verne's voyages, and Méliès' enchanted cinema"

Together these two great exponents of the Golden Age span three-quarters of their century, from the forward-looking nature of Rembrandt's oeuvre to the retrospective cast of Vermeer's. Moreover their oeuvres—one impressively large and the other equally small—exhibit startling divergent interests in the issues of visuality and representation. From their headquarters in Amsterdam and Delft, respectively, they develop contrasting studio practices and relations with the market, and explore different subjects and mediums. Topics will include: investigations of the uses of light; methods of self-representation; depictions of women and the domestic sphere; Rembrandt's experiments in etching and Vermeer's with the camera obscura and opticality; and their histories of reception, including the consequential results of the Rembrandt Research Project.

ARTH 6560,Aesthetic Theory: The End of Art,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"GERST 6560, PHIL 6951",,,,"This course investigates the emergence of aesthetics as its own philosophical discipline at the end of the eighteenth century.  In a first phase, we will examine the rationalist articulation of aesthetics in Baumgarten's work and the empiricist theory of taste, particularly Burke's Enquiry.  Drawing on the findings of these two traditions, Kant's Critique of Judgment (1790) inaugurated a preoccupation in German philosophy around 1800 with the philosophical status of the beautiful and of art.  Especially in Romantic theory and practice, art was meant to provide a solution to the philosophical dilemmas in the wake of Kant's critical philosophy.  However, already in Hegel's Phenomenology, and more explicitly in the Encyclopedia and the Lectures on Aesthetics, art lost this elevated position vis-à-vis philosophy.  Taking this observation as a guiding thread, the main part of the course is structured around in-depth readings that may include Kant, Schiller, Schelling, the Schlegels, Novalis, Hölderlin, and Hegel.  Further readings may include writings by contemporary philosophers and theoreticians--such as Adorno, Allison, Danto, Deleuze, Derrida, Ginsborg, Guyer, Lyotard et al.--whose work on aesthetics takes its starting point from the philosophical issues surrounding the emergence of aesthetic theory only to transcend these historical confines and formulate contemporary positions on the status of the aesthetic and of art.  The following questions will be addressed: What are the conditions for the move from the subjective judgment of taste (Kant) to objective beauty (Romantics, Hegel)?  How is the relation of art and nature reconceived by the Romantics?  What is the relation of aesthetic theory and the history of art?  Is philosophy the end of art?"

Moreover their oeuvres—one impressively large and the other equally small—exhibit startling divergent interests in the issues of visuality and representation. From their headquarters in Amsterdam and Delft, respectively, they develop contrasting studio practices and relations with the market, and explore different subjects and mediums. Topics will include: investigations of the uses of light; methods of self-representation; depictions of women and the domestic sphere; Rembrandt's experiments in etching and Vermeer's with the camera obscura and opticality; and their histories of reception, including the consequential results of the Rembrandt Research Project.

These dynamics include not only the evident reverberations of practice in philosophical reflection and socioreligious institutions, but also wide-ranging processes of stylization, elaboration, and popularization found throughout South Asian culture. In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts. To keep the interaction between internal practice and broader world views central, we will examine both Hindu and Buddhist sources, consistently examining the ways in which similar practices are given distinct shapes by the two religious traditions"

Along with references to theoretical frameworks, original writings representative of modern Buddhist thoughts are examined. Moreover, a set of case studies illustrative of Buddhist and non-Buddhist conceptualizations of Buddhism that emerged in colonial India, Burma and Sri Lanka are discussed. They exemplify how a religion with ancient roots was capable of engaging in modern ideas, processes and projects not just by conceding to modernity but also by challenging and reconstructing it.

This period witnessed epochal changes in Chinese society and culture, ranging from the adoption of republican government and expansion of print culture to the promotion of women's rights and explosion of nationalism. Taken together, these and other changes can be said to signify the emergence of Chinese modernity. Yet what exactly do we mean by the term ""modernity""? And what makes modern China ""modern""? This class will seek to answer these questions by examining in detail the concrete developments that were occurring in different spheres of Chinese society in the early twentieth century and how these developments impacted the lives of individual Chinese, while also critically engaging the rich variety of ways that scholars have utilized the concept of modernity to understand and analyze them. In the process, we will learn to be alert to such issues as the potentially hegemonic aspects of ""modernity"" as a conceptual category, the ways in which modernity both integrates and transforms previously existing sociocultural patterns, and the inherent tension between the universalizing pretensions of modernity and the persistence of cultural particularism"

We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did.

Along with references to theoretical frameworks, original writings representative of modern Buddhist thoughts are examined. Moreover, a set of case studies illustrative of Buddhist and non-Buddhist conceptualizations of Buddhism that emerged in colonial India, Burma and Sri Lanka are discussed. They exemplify how a religion with ancient roots was capable of engaging in modern ideas, processes and projects not just by conceding to modernity but also by challenging and reconstructing it.

This unprecedented enchantment with love not only liberated inner emotions but also involved in the redefinition of self and the cultural and social order.

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista"

As a result, scholars, writers and filmmakers continue to re-examine the war from multiple angles. Nonetheless, most accounts of the war marginalize Africa's role and the consequences of the war for African communities.   This course considers the new historiography on World War II that aims to put the 'world' back into our analysis of WW II and considers the ways in which imperialism, race and gender shaped the prosecution and the consequences of the war.  It focuses specifically on Africa's social, economic and political engagement with the powers at the center of the conflict and introduces students to emerging debates in African historiography and the historiography of World War II"

ASRC 3010,Sweetness: How Sugar Built the Modern World,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,LATA 3015,(HA-AS),(GHB),,"Rice, wheat, and maize are examples of crops that sustained the civilizations in which they were cultivated for centuries. Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen"

What experiences, cultural understandings and social problems shape the identities of people of African descent? In order to address these questions, the course focuses on the people who were relocated by the Atlantic slave trade to the Caribbean, South and Central America, and the United States, and on their subsequent migrations. We will explore the disparate cultural, national, historical and intellectual contexts in which Black identities are constructed, revealing both commonalities and differences. Paying specific attention to how racial identity is shaped by social context, the course will interrogate theories of Black identity formation and notions of Black nationhood, and will examine different perspectives on Diaspora theory. While readings are interdisciplinary in approach, our understandings of Blacks in the Atlantic world will be informed by ethnographic, historical and literary texts covering many cultural contexts including the U.S., England, Kenya, South Africa, Haiti, Puerto Rico, Brazil, Jamaica and the Dominican Republic.

ASRC 3404,Perspectives on Africa and Aid,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,GOVT 3404,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"In recent times there has been a lot more than usual criticism of aid and its consequences in Africa. Many have argued that aid does more harm than good in the recipient countries. At the same time, supporters of aid continue to insist that there is nothing or not much that is wrong with aid; it is only that the countries that need it do not get enough of it and in a timely fashion. A good part of the debate turns on what, besides aid, will help to solve Africa's many problems. Here attention turns on the role of trade and its impact on Africa's fortunes. Another strand of the debate turns on the internal dynamics of various African countries themselves. Students need to have an expansive view of aid and be aided in their choices respecting their attitudes towards global Africa"

The incident highlighted the plight of children affected by conflicts and the nature of the activities of aid agencies and organizations. Among them Zoe's Ark posed the principle that African children essentially become wards humanitarians during war because the parents are incapable and in many cases unwilling to take care of them. This course examines arguments used by humanitarian organizations to justify both the principle of intervention and their own activities in Africa"

The comparative reflection will engage between English and French, starting with the work of Frantz Fanon and its foundational role in the formation of postcolonial studies in the 1980s. This bilingual line will take us to points of intersection between the ""colonial question"" and the ""question noire,"" as we place anticolonial and postcolonial arguments in dialogue with pioneering works by Black essayists, including W.E.B. Du Bois, Jean Price-Mars, C.L.R. James, Frantz Fanon. Finally, tracing the ties between this Black Atlantic history of intellectual emancipation and B.R. Ambedkar's critique of caste in the context of India's anticolonial struggle will help form a differentiated understanding of the poetics of politics"

The course will utilize Black feminist theory, consumption theory, and youth culture theory to help students interpret and critique the ways in which women are represented in hip hop music, art, fashion, and dance, and in its surrounding culture. Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

From the seventeenth-century West African Sahel, where shifting categories of blackness were articulated long before the advent of French colonial rule, to the twentieth century's globally interconnected black freedom struggles, we will plot out chronologies of blackness to better discern the conditions under which blackness becomes a meaningful, yet ever mutating signifier.

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development.

Focusing on the postcolonial African city as a space of musical innovation and contestation, it critically examines the relationship between popular culture and historic and ongoing processes of urbanization. How has music in Africa provided a unique position of individual and communal articulation with (post)colonialism, nationalism, crisis, and global representation? How has music worked to empower or disempower certain populations, and what are the implications of its use in the interest of politics? How do frameworks such as cosmopolitanism and Afropolitanism expand or limit our understandings of popular musical cultures in Africa? Participants in the seminar will engage music not only from a lyrical perspective but also as a complex of aural signs that index tradition, globality, ethnicity, race, nation, and gender and that are constituted in the social relationships between performers and audiences"

Interest in this ""medicalization of life"" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine"

Along with major cultural and social transformations such as commercialization, the spread of literacy and printing, and increased social mobility, early modern China in particular witnessed the cult of love (qing). This unprecedented enchantment with love not only liberated inner emotions but also involved in the redefinition of self and the cultural and social order.

This period witnessed epochal changes in Chinese society and culture, ranging from the adoption of republican government and expansion of print culture to the promotion of women's rights and explosion of nationalism. Taken together, these and other changes can be said to signify the emergence of Chinese modernity. Yet what exactly do we mean by the term ""modernity""? And what makes modern China ""modern""? This class will seek to answer these questions by examining in detail the concrete developments that were occurring in different spheres of Chinese society in the early twentieth century and how these developments impacted the lives of individual Chinese, while also critically engaging the rich variety of ways that scholars have utilized the concept of modernity to understand and analyze them. In the process, we will learn to be alert to such issues as the potentially hegemonic aspects of ""modernity"" as a conceptual category, the ways in which modernity both integrates and transforms previously existing sociocultural patterns, and the inherent tension between the universalizing pretensions of modernity and the persistence of cultural particularism"

The seminar explores the contributions that a literary-theory perspective can make to an understanding of the globalized present, by retracing the genealogy of ""the knowledge society"" in the development of colonial ""politics of knowledge"" and their ulterior dissection by anticolonial, de-colonial and postcolonial critiques. Going back to the Orientalist invention of the comparative study of languages, we trace the relation of poetics to politics through successive stages of scholarship and intellectual struggle, and study the power of literary critique in cultural hegemony, past and present. Readings will possibly include Jones, Renan, Saussure, Said, Lyotard, Jameson, Dirlik, Spivak, Apter, among others"

Through readings of primarily British and French criticism and philosophy, we will examine the empirical and psychological basis of aesthetics as indicative of the progress of modernity, but we will also investigate Kant's transcendental founding of aesthetics in a self-reflexive subject. Some topics orienting our discussion: the relation of empirical epistemology and linguistic theory to neoclassical conceptions of figurative language; the consequences of an aesthetics of the sublime for formal and generic theories of literature; tragedy and the pleasures of pain; ideology and aesthetics; and, especially, the relation of aesthetics to ethics. Authors include. Longinus, Boileau, Shaftesbury, Hume, Burke, Lessing, Rousseau, and Kant"

What relation(s) do specific textual/poetic features or strategies have to geopolitical, cultural, historical, economic circumstances, and to the condition(s) of what has come to be called the ""postcolonial"" in particular?

The methods to be discussed include the framework of inter-regional input-output (IRIO), structural path analysis (SPA), computable general equilibrium (CGE), and agent-based modeling (ABM). We will begin with the top-down IMPLAN analyses, which are appropriate for static, short-term planning challenges, but less so for regions and cities that change continuously. Regions and cities are adaptive, self-organizing systems of individuals whose interdependent actions create urban forms and produce spatial patterns. To explore how macro-patterns emerge from micro-behavior, we will discuss the bottom-up framework of agent-based modeling. The models to be discussed are analytically intractable: results can only be derived using numerical simulations. The analysis therefore requires computer packages, including IMPLAN, Excel, GAMS, and NetLogo. "

Turbulent convection in the outer core generates the earth's magnetic field. The viscous mantle (outer half of the Earth) is slowly but vigorously convecting, and consequently the Earth's surface is dynamic. Viscosity is not important in the oceans and atmosphere, but the flow there is fast enough for the rotation of the Earth to become a dominant control. Electromagnetic effects again dominate in the solar wind and magnetosphere. This course investigates the Earth using fluid dynamics. For students in the Earth sciences it provides an opportunity to learn the insights that can be provided by fluid dynamics. For students who know fluid dynamics from other fields the course provides spectacular applications and an opportunity to learn about the Earth system in a different and unusually fundamental way"

EDUC 5020,Education and Development in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 6600,,,,"In the 1950s and 1960s, the human capital theory that emphasizes the importance of formal education for achievement of full productive potential of individuals and economic growth and development of countries enjoyed a renewed popularity. African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration"

ENGL 1134,FWS: True Stories,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"When students write personal essays for college applications, they often discover how challenging it can be to write about themselves. In this course, we'll examine how well-known authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Alison Bechdel, Tim O'Brien, and others construct their public, written selves. We'll also consider how the style of writing affects how readers understand an author's personality and motives. Readings will include short essays, possible some poems, and a few longer works. Through the writing frequent essays, we'll explore why and how people write about themselves—for self-exploration, political or social change, purely to practice a form of art, or for other reasons—and we'll investigate how writing shapes lived experience"

ENGL 1147,FWS: Mystery in the Story,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"What makes a story, and what makes it a mystery story? In this course, we'll study and write about the nature of narratives, taking the classic mystery tale written by such writers as Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Chandler as typical of intricately plotted stories of suspense and disclosure that have been written and filmed in many genres: Greek tragedy, horror tales by Poe and Shirley Jackson, psychological thrillers by Ruth Rendell and Patricia Highsmith, neo-noir films such as Memento and Fight Club, and postmodern mystery parodies such as those of Paul Auster and Jorge Luis Borges.

In addition to entertaining us or enticing us, they carry implied messages about who we are, what world we live in, and what we should value. Topics and reading lists vary from section to section, but all are built on the assumption that learning to decode these messages is a survival skill in today's media-saturated world and also excellent training for reading literature.

ENGL 1183,FWS: Word and Image,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"Writers and artists from Homer to Raymond Pettibon have been fascinated by the relationship between words and images, a relationship that is sometimes imagined as a competition, sometimes as a collaboration. What are the differences between literary and visual media? What can the juxtaposition of word and image teach us about the nature of representation? What other kinds of ends (satiric, esoteric, etc.) do artists and writers hope to achieve by coupling words with images? To explore these questions, we will consult works drawn from a range of periods and genres (for example, graphic novels, medieval manuscripts, contemporary art and new media, emblem books, film, literary gaming, fiction and poetry). The course is structured around a progressive set of writing assignments and will include both informal exercises as well as formal essays"

Readings include key texts from such schools as New Criticism, psychoanalysis, structuralism, post-structuralism, Marxism, feminism, and postcolonial studies. The course gives students a solid foundation in the issues, techniques, and vocabularies of advanced literary analysis. While literary questions are predominant throughout the semester, this course is nevertheless designed to be accessible and useful not only for English and literature majors (and prospective majors) but also for anyone interested in gaining a foundation in aesthetic and cultural analysis. The contemporary humanistic disciplines largely share a technical vocabulary, and this class provides undergraduates from various fields a firm grounding in the key concepts and issues of what has come to be called ""theory."""

From Gulliver's Travels to ""The Tyger,"" from Jane Austen to ""Jabberwocky:"" your favorite authors writing today know these classics. This course surveys 250 years of English poetry and prose, from the barbed wit of Swift and Pope and the beguiling wanderings of the Romantics poets, to the myths retold by Victorian writers and the rumblings of war in Modernism.

ENGL 2035,Science Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,"Spring, summer",,,"COML 2035, STS 2131",(CA-AS),(GB),,"Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is ""the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality."" Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future"
ENGL 2040,Introduction to American Literature: Civil War to the Present,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 2040,(LA-AS),,,"This course will introduce students to American literature from the Civil War to the present. We will consider a wide range of authors and literary movements while paying close attention to radical shifts in American culture in the past century and a half.

How does this writing engage central issues of modern American culture such as race, immigration, class mobility, and technology? The class will examine a variety of genres including poetry, novels, manifestos, and drama. Authors include Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, T.S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, William Faulkner, Felipe Alfau, Langston Hughes, Allen Ginsberg, Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison, and others"
ENGL 2080,Shakespeare and the Twentieth and Twenty-First Centuries,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PMA 2681,(LA-AS),(HB),,"What can we learn about Shakespeare's plays from their reception by late modernity?

We will also pay attention to issues of identity, migration and the creation of the Caribbean diaspora.

ENGL 2605,"Cannibals, Vampires, Colonizers, and Other Fearsome Figures in Native American Literature",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"Native American depictions of human interactions with frightening beings can help readers appreciate Indigenous perspectives and experiences. That is, when contemporary Indigenous writers repurpose features of gothic, fantasy, sci-fi, or environmentalist fiction, their reimagined insatiable antagonists are almost universally formed as critical representations of colonialism, while monstrosity emerges from transgressions against Indigenous values and relationships. In reading for this course, we'll examine Indigenous depictions of voracious beings, the relationships these fearsome figures attempt to disrupt, and the means by which protagonists fight their demons. Through the lens of critical Indigenous theory and a sampling of short stories, novels, ethnographies, historical readings, and films, this course will examine how Native American authors continue a long-established practice of balancing relationships through storytelling and story-writing"

ENGL 3120,Beowulf,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6120, MEDVL 3120, MEDVL 6120",(LA-AS),(HB),,"In recent years, Beowulf has received renewed attention in popular culture, thanks to the production of two recent Beowulf movies and riveting new translations (eg. Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"
ENGL 3190,Chaucer,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MEDVL 3190,(LA-AS),(HB),,"An introduction to the poetry of Chaucer, often considered the ""founder"" of modern English literature, as well as an introduction to the literary, social, and cultural setting in which he developed his poetry.  No previous knowledge of Chaucer or his language (Middle English) is required, but students will develop a set of tools for independent work, including understanding Chaucer's life, language, uses of other literature, connections to other writers (a ""community"" of poets?), political setting, and philosophical (moral, sociological, political, etc.) outlook.  How should we assess Chaucer? What did ""English literature"" mean then? What did he ""found""? Three papers and final (take-home) exam"
ENGL 3270,Shakespeare: The Late Plays,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PMA 3770,(LA-AS),(HB),,"The course focuses on Shakespeare's middle to late plays, from the ""problem comedies,"" through the great tragedies and romances.  While we will pay particular attention to questions of dramatic form (genre) and historical context (including ways in which the plays themselves call context into question), the primary concentration will be on careful close readings of the language of the play-texts, in relation to critical questions of subjectivity, power, and art. On the way, we will encounter problems of sexuality, identity, emotion, the body, family, violence, politics, God, the nation, nature and money (not necessarily in that order)"
ENGL 3330,Fictions of Self-Invention: The Eighteenth Century Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"If the Satanic fantasy is to believe ourselves ""Self-begot, self-raised by our own quick'ning power,"" as Milton says, then the early novel is diabolical. Foundlings and orphans, abandoned wives, abducted daughters, incestuous marriages, exiled or restlessly traveling sons: early fiction imagines the possibility of socially inventing ourselves by challenging and leaving behind both the family defined by birth and a place called home. We will examine the ideology of self-invention—its promotion of individual autonomy through education, culture, sex, and economics—in such novels as Defoe's Moll Flanders, Haywood's Love in Excess, Fielding's Tom Jones, Austen's Emma. We will also examine how fiction tries to invent itself by turning to forms of realism and forgetting the history of literature"
ENGL 3360,American Drama and Theatre,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AMST 3360, PMA 3757",(LA-AS),,,"Explores major American playwrights from 1900 to 1960, introducing students to American theatre as a significant part of modern American cultural history. We will consider the ways in which theatre has contributed to the construction and deconstruction of a national identity. Similarly, we will examine the influence of the American Theatre on and in film. We will pay special attention to the social, political, and aesthetic contexts of the time period and discuss the shifting popularity of dramatic forms, including melodrama, realism, expressionism, absurdism, and the folk play, in the American theatre canon. Authors include O'Neill, Glaspell, Odets, Rice, Hellman, Hughes, Miller, Williams, and Albee, among others"
ENGL 3470,The Victorian Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Jane Austen and zombies, A Christmas Carol in 3D, PBS miniseries: why is nineteenth-century fiction so un-dead? The plot of the Victorian novel-sexual betrayal, pathological greed, the sadistic damage wrought on helpless children-reflects wrenching social, scientific, and technological transformations whose global sweep rivals that of our own era's conflicts. Intertwining domestic and imperial spaces, realistic fiction embodied the most innovative attempt to grasp and contain such seismic shifts in an entertaining idiom for a rising mass readership. These works refract the cultural debates of the age and suggest sources of redemption. We can take pleasure in them even as we critically analyze how the Victorians live now. Likely authors include: Dickens, Gaskell, Brontë, Eliot, Collins and Hardy"
ENGL 3530,"Imagining India, Home and Diaspora",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASIAN 3368,(LA-AS),(GB),,"A modern country and an ancient civilization, India has been imagined through the ages in many different ways.

This failure is due to the inability of national policy to imagine a world beyond a boundary drawn by the formative capitalist ideas of property, production, and profit. The course will begin by discussing the historical origin and continuing force of these ideas while raising questions about their limits. It will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance. The alternatives we will query come from a range of Indigenous writers of fiction, poetry, and theory, who locate themselves in Native American (north and south), Aboriginal, and Maori communities"
ENGL 3670,Modern American Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 3670,(LA-AS),,,"An introduction to recent American fiction through close reading of novels and short fiction since 1970. Some consistent themes will be resistance and revolt, ideas of gender, race and identity, power and marginality, history and memory, and definitions of America.

Sandra Cisneros, Junot Diaz, Sonia Sotomayor and DREAMers provide another set of representations. In this course we will read fiction, poetry, and memoirs about the experience of growing up in the U.S. We will consider the narratives that migrant farmworkers, actors, novelists, and activists produce as they think about how children learn and navigate the processes called racialization, sexualization, and gendering. We will also compare this literature to the work of visual artists like Ana Mendieta as well as filmmakers like Robert Rodriguez"
ENGL 3721,"Food, Gender, and Culture",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 3720, FGSS 3720",(LA-AS),,,"In addition to nourishing the body, food operates as a cultural system that produces and reflects group and individual identities. In this class we will examine foodways-the behaviors and beliefs attached to the production, distribution, and consumption of food-to explore the way food practices help shape our sense of gender, race, sexual orientation, and national identity. In doing so we will focus primarily on literature and film but will also range into the fields of anthropology, sociology, and history. Some questions under discussion: How do factors such as gender, class, race, and religion shape the foods we eat and the circumstances in which we eat them? How do writers use the language of food to explore issues such as gender, sexuality, class, and race?"

Newton, Bobby Seale, David Hilliard, George Jackson, Elaine Brown, Angela Davis, Eldridge Cleaver and Assata Shakur, among others.  Concomitantly, we will examine writings by a new generation of Black Panther authors, from Mary Williams, the adopted daughter of Jane Fonda to Ericka Brown, the daughter of Elaine Brown, with whom we will dialogue in a session about her ""Black Panther Princess"" project.  We will examine the complex and sometimes forgotten origins of the Black Panther Party as a political movement in the U.S. South.  We will examine the impact of prison literature as a genre on the development of this body of autobiographical work.  Finally, we will examine the impact of the body of Black Panther autobiography on film.  The autobiographical literature of this movement is also a valuable resource to learn about in light of contemporary movements that reflect on relationships between communities and strategies of policing"
ENGL 4020,Literature as Moral Inquiry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot's Middlemarch, Coetzee's Disgrace, Morrison's Beloved, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and Achebe's Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro"
ENGL 4090,Theories of Popular Culture,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"Why study popular culture? Although it is often equated with mass culture and perceived to be unworthy of academic study, this course argues that popular culture is an important site for the production of both pleasure and politics. We consider a range of theoretical approaches and read a spectrum of cultural critics and theorists, from those who equate the popular with the ""folk"" and the marginalized to those who explore the highly mediated and commercialized aspects of the popular. We look across media and its sites—television, film, the porn industry, baseball, popular music, and Starbucks coffee shops. Studies of texts will be located in economic, political, and social contexts. Also, we ask what feelings of desire, pleasure, fear, and disgust does popular culture generate?"

Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"

What kind of mind creates a file? ""Baroque Files"" pursues the history, philosophy and concept of the file from Shakespeare and Cervantes to Milton and Defoe.

Considering analyses of African American, Caribbean, Asian-American, South African, and Latino interactions with hip hop, the course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about broader gender constructions? How can we compare the portrayal of women in hip hop to representations of women in related musical genres?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

FREN 3765,The Spectacular Fin-de-siecle,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARTH 3765, VISST 3765",(LA-AS),(HB),,"This course traces the exchanges between spectacular entertainments and avant-garde art that shaped late nineteenth-century European visual culture, and gave rise to collective spectatorship transgressing anarchist, bohemian, and bourgeois boundaries. We begin with politically-charged Montmartre cabarets—Le Chat Noir, Moulin Rouge—where shadow theater, acrobats, and quadrille dancers inspired the street posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlin, and Vallotton. We follow their influence to James Ensor's Ostend carnivals and Les XX (The Twenty), the painters' coalition dedicated to the Belgian Workers Party, and then look at fin-de-siècle print culture through Redon's haunting ""noirs,"" lithographic albums inspired by Poe's tales of horror. We consider the Pont Aven Symbolists' turn from material to dream worlds visualized through stained glass and medieval tapestry; the close ties between Neo-impressionist painters and anarchist art critics; the Nabis (Prophets) pre-cinematic crowd scenes and the Lumière Brothers; and why the Nabis Vuillard and Bonnard abandoned their easels for costume and set design at the Théâtre d'Art. We consider the 1889 exposition universelle and the pavilions that fueled mass colonial fantasies and Gauguin's departure for Tahiti. Woven throughout are larger performances of decadence, crowds, and hysteria as modernity, and tensions between industrial life and utopic longing that led Symbolists to read Monet's Giverny grainstacks series as cosmic orbs, ""the terrestrial life of the globe and the course of earth through space."" We will see the epoch illumined by marvel—electric lighting, phantasmagoria, Jules Verne's voyages, and Méliès' enchanted cinema"

How does advertising sell the current dystopia as ""cool capitalism""? And what roles do race and gender play? This seminar examines fictions (written and cinematic) that maintain but also contest global capitalism as the dominant social, economic, and political order. With Marx's and later Marxist writings, we consider such ""fables"" as Roland Barthes, Mythologies; Thomas Pynchon, The Crying of Lot 49; David Fincher, Fight Club; and Lizzie Borden, Born in Flames. Analyzing these texts and constructing arguments about them will hone our analytical reading and critical writing skills"
GERST 1150,FWS: German Lyric Poetry,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"Friedrich Hölderlin, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Celan are arguably the most influential lyric poets to have written in German.  Although each responded to events of his day (the French Revolution, First World War, and Second World War, respectively), they all aspired to transcend their immediate contexts. Their success is indicated by the interest prominent philosophers have taken in their work and the many musical settings their poetry has inspired. This seminar will address concerns common to all three writers: individual and collective memory, the (dis)enchantment of the world, the materiality and musicality of language, and the encounter with the foreign. Writing assignments are designed to help you articulate critical argumentation"

This course explores seriality in literature and popular culture (television, film, new media) and examines the strategies of suspense, entertainment, and anticipation that connect installments or episodes into novels, seasons, series, and franchises. Essay assignments will draw on textual and cultural analysis as well as critical discussions of series (both literary and popular) to practice effective academic writing"

Journalists and historians were baffled by the viewers' deeply emotional response, since no such reaction had followed previous attempts to confront Germans with the Shoah. Was a TV mini-series really the right way to address the Holocaust? Today, barely a day goes by without some fictional, docufictional, or documentary film/series covering the Holocaust, German unification, 1970s terrorism, etc. Are these examples of ""histotainment"" or ""historical pornography""? Is history a commodity to identify with Holocaust-victims one day and with Germans who died during WWII the next? How do TV-narratives react to or influence collective memory? This course explores selected TV films/series and their ensuing debates, both contrasted with other approaches to 'televising history, e.g. Edgar Reitz' epic series ""Heimat.""   "

Beginning with a look at expressionist and crime films of Weimar Germany, we will then examine a body of classic films made in Hollywood by German and Austrian exiles. Film noir of the 1940s and 50s offered mass audiences a critical view of U.S. society, and exiled directors were often ambivalent about their new home, an attitude reflected in films such as Scarlet Street (1945), Detour (1945), and Criss Cross (1949). We will also discuss more recent films with surprising links to both film noir and German expressionism, including Blue Velvet (1986), Dark City (1998), and The Big Lebowski (1998).

Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly ""universal"" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional contexts"

This entails an exploration of experiments with literary language and form (short prose, essay, interior monologue) and of crucial concepts at the threshold of modernity: Sexuality and gender, history and myth, representation and the limits thereof, and, as the central, precarious and 'nervous' center: the decentered subject.

GERST 6560,Aesthetic Theory: The End of Art,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARTH 6560, PHIL 6951",,,,"This course investigates the emergence of aesthetics as its own philosophical discipline at the end of the eighteenth century.  In a first phase, we will examine the rationalist articulation of aesthetics in Baumgarten's work and the empiricist theory of taste, particularly Burke's Enquiry.  Drawing on the findings of these two traditions, Kant's Critique of Judgment (1790) inaugurated a preoccupation in German philosophy around 1800 with the philosophical status of the beautiful and of art.  Especially in Romantic theory and practice, art was meant to provide a solution to the philosophical dilemmas in the wake of Kant's critical philosophy.  However, already in Hegel's Phenomenology, and more explicitly in the Encyclopedia and the Lectures on Aesthetics, art lost this elevated position vis-à-vis philosophy.  Taking this observation as a guiding thread, the main part of the course is structured around in-depth readings that may include Kant, Schiller, Schelling, the Schlegels, Novalis, Hölderlin, and Hegel.  Further readings may include writings by contemporary philosophers and theoreticians--such as Adorno, Allison, Danto, Deleuze, Derrida, Ginsborg, Guyer, Lyotard et al.--whose work on aesthetics takes its starting point from the philosophical issues surrounding the emergence of aesthetic theory only to transcend these historical confines and formulate contemporary positions on the status of the aesthetic and of art.  The following questions will be addressed: What are the conditions for the move from the subjective judgment of taste (Kant) to objective beauty (Romantics, Hegel)?  How is the relation of art and nature reconceived by the Romantics?  What is the relation of aesthetic theory and the history of art?  Is philosophy the end of art?"

Selected readings are exemplary rather than comprehensive and focus on literature, philosophy, and critical theories of language and history.

The center of this period is marked by the political leadership (446-429 BCE) of Pericles. The resulting three decade war with the Peloponnesian league, as recorded by Thucydides and others, forms the third major topic, and the final weeks will trace the fate of Socrates.  Fifth century Athens is richly documented: readings (all in English) from Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and other texts and inscriptions"

We will consider the roles played by both institutions (congress, the bureaucracy and interests groups) and everyday people. Finally, we will closely study several specific policy arenas (a few likely candidates include: education policy, health policy, social welfare policy and housing policy).

GOVT 3537,Zionism and Its Discontents,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"JWST 3537, NES 3537, RELST 3537",(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course examines the history of Zionism as an idea and as a political movement in all its various forms, currents, and transformations from its origins in mid-nineteenth century Europe to the present. Despite its success in establishing the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism, which also sought to ""normalize"" Jewish collective life and provide a safe haven from persecution for the Jews, has encountered multiple challenges from within and without. Some continue to think of it as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people while others regard it is a Western inspired colonial project. Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel. The course also considers the phenomenon of post-Zionism in Israeli historiography as well as Zionism's difficulty in coming to terms with the idea and reality that two peoples rather than one live in the land west of the Jordan"

The Social Contract and its Discontents,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,"COML 3780, FREN 3780",,,,"When Jean-Jacques Rousseau introduced the concept of the ""general will"" in his classic text The Social Contract, he made what was then an unprecedented and scandalous claim: that the people as a whole, and not an individual agent, could be the subject of political will and self-determination.  This claim was all the more revolutionary in that historically ""the people"" [ie peuple] named those poor masses who had no political representation, and who were subjects of the state only to the extent that they were subject to the will of a sovereign monarch.  What then is ""the people,"" and how is it constituted as a collective subject?  How does a people speak, or make its will known?  Can that will be represented or institutionalized?  Do all people belong to the people?  How inclusive is the social contract?  This course will examine crucial moments in the constitution of the people from the French Revolution to the present day, considering the crisis of political representation they have alternately exposed or engendered and the forms of the social contract to which they have given rise.  Our discussions will range from major political events (the French and Haitian Revolutions, the Paris Commune, colonialism and decolonization, May '68) to contemporary debates around universalism, secularism, immigration, and ""marriage for all.""  Readings by Rousseau, Robespierre, L'Ouverture, Michelet, Marx, Freud, Arendt, Balibar, and Rancière"

HIST 2063,"Anarchism: History, Theory, Practice",4,Graded,Spring,,,LATA 2063,,(HA-AS),,"Anarchism. What is it good for?  A political philosophy and approach to social organization that arose simultaneous with other grand  ""–isms,"" anarchism, perhaps more than any other idea and practice, has been condensed down by its critics and observers into a vague set of often contradictory caricatures. Is 'it' characterized by bohemian communities of nihilists, their rebellion culturally innovative but politically impotent, book-ended by Friedrich Nietzsche and Johnny Rotten?  Or is 'it' individualist libertarians who walk in the ideological footsteps of Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand? Or collectivist anti-capitalists who tread the paths blazed by  Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin? Or, most famously, is 'it' a murky underworld of conspiratorial bomb throwers, held together less by bonds of solidarity than by a commitment to violence?  This seminar provides some relief from such limited and constraining perspectives by taking anarchism seriously as a social and political practice and tradition, one rooted largely in the left-wing critique of both the state and capitalism"

Scrutinizes how racial hierarchies, social movements, the political economy, and prisoners themselves influenced the development of the penal system and in turn, how the growth in the carceral system has reshaped U.S. society. Will focus on key turning points in the history of the U.S. prison, such as the birth of the prison in the late 18th century, the Jacksonian and Progressive era prison reforms, and the convict leasing system in the south after the Civil War. We will give particular attention to the period since 1945 and the roots of today's hyper-incarceration, such as ""law and order"" politics and the ""War on Drugs."""

HIST 2543,In the Crossfire of Empires: Africa and World War II,4,Graded,Spring,,,ASRC 2543,(HA-AS),,,"World War II was one of the most transformative periods in the history of the 20th century. As a result, scholars, writers and filmmakers continue to re-examine the war from multiple angles. Nonetheless, most accounts of the war marginalize Africa's role and the consequences of the war for African communities.   This course considers the new historiography on World War II that aims to put the 'world' back into our analysis of WW II and considers the ways in which imperialism, race and gender shaped the prosecution and the consequences of the war.  It focuses specifically on Africa's social, economic and political engagement with the powers at the center of the conflict and introduces students to emerging debates in African historiography and the historiography of World War II"
HIST 2571,China Encounters the World,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASIAN 2257, CAPS 2570",(HA-AS),(GB),,"This is a lecture and discussion course focusing on how China has encountered the world since the 17th century, with an emphasis on the late 19th and 20th-centuries. In particular, it will analyze the age-old Chinese ""Central Kingdom "" conception and how the conception was challenged during modern times as the result of Western and Japanese incursion and China's inability to deal with the consequences of the incursion. It will further analyze the impact of the Chinese ""victim mentality"" in order to pursue a deeper understanding of why radical revolutions have dominated China's modern history. While the emphasis of this course is China's external relations, foreign policy issues will be examined in the context of China's political, economic and social developments in broader terms. The course's purpose is not just to impart information but also to cultivate a basic understanding of the significance of the Chinese experience in the age of worldwide modernization. Grade in this class will be calculated on the basis of class participation, quizzes, midterm and final exams, and one essay assignment"
HIST 2660,Everything You Know About Indians is Wrong: Unlearning Native American History,4,Graded,Spring,,,"AIS 2660, AMST 2660",(HA-AS),(HB),,"One thing many Americans think they know is their Indians: Pocahontas, the First Thanksgiving, fighting cowboys, reservation poverty, and casino riches. Under our very noses, however, Native American history has evolved into one of the most exciting, dynamic, and contentious fields of inquiry into America's past. It is now safer to assume, as Comanche historian Paul Chaat Smith has pointed out, that everything you know about Indians is in fact wrong. Most people have much to ""unlearn"" about Native American history before true learning can take place. This course aims to achieve that end by (re)introducing students to key themes and trends in the history of North America's indigenous nations. Employing an issues-oriented approach, the course stresses the ongoing complexity of Native American societies' engagements with varieties of settler colonialism since 1492 and dedicates itself to a concerted program of myth-busting. As such, the course will provide numerous opportunities for students to develop their critical thinking and reading skills"

HIST 2676,Periclean Athens,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"CLASS 2676, GOVT 2676",(HA-AS),(HB),,"Beginning with the archaic background of aristocratic, religious, cultural and military traditions of mainland Greece, we will follow the Athenian plunge into democracy, the theatrical translation of traditional myths into contemporary issues, radical speculation on religion, science, natural law, national identities, economically supported by a large class of slaves and an unquestioned commitment to aggressive imperialism. The center of this period is marked by the political leadership (446-429 BCE) of Pericles. The resulting three decade war with the Peloponnesian league, as recorded by Thucydides and others, forms the third major topic, and the final weeks will trace the fate of Socrates.  Fifth century Athens is richly documented: readings (all in English) from Herodotus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides, Aristophanes, Thucydides, Plato and other texts and inscriptions"

HIST 2742,Cultures of the Middle Ages,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MEDVL 2130,(CA-AS),(HB),,"Topic: Medieval Frontier Societies  It's bad enough to run up against a border: at least you know where you stand. The frontier, however -- that fuzzy, murky zone that envelops the border while making its precise contours invisible -- is far more ambiguous, dangerous ground to tread. People, ideas, and other contraband criss-cross it; men (and sometimes women) make their own law; cultures clash and conspire together. At the margins of Europe -- Ireland, Wales, Scandinavia, Poland, Germany, the Low Countries, Spain, Sicily, the Levant -- medieval people discovered what every Trekkie knows: final frontiers, spaces of both oppression and opportunity. This course will explore some of the exchanges, friendly and otherwise, that took place at the edges of the medieval world, seeding many of the most radical developments which shaped the modern world"
HIST 2862,"Before the Modern: European Culture, Thought, and Politics (1500 to1750)",4,Graded,Spring,,,,(HA-AS),(HB),,"The western world before the modern age was a place where kings were thought to have mystical powers, where faith in an omnipresent God coexisted with a belief in magic and witches, where slavery was seen as perfectly natural, where Jews and lepers were viewed as untouchable, and where spectacles of execution drew thousands of spectators eager to watch human beings be put to death. Through a variety of cultural, philosophical, and political texts, we will explore how the people of pre-modern Europe made sense of their world, and how this world slowly began to disappear at the dawn of the modern age"
HIST 2985,Transformations in Twentieth Century China,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASIAN 2286,(HA-AS),(GB),,"The twentieth century was a time of unprecedented change in China, as the country's ancient imperial system collapsed and a new modern order began to emerge. This course will explore the myriad transformations that occurred during this remarkable century of revolution and renewal. Among the major changes that we will focus on are the fall of the Qing dynasty, the intellectual awakening of May Fourth, the rise of the Nationalist party-state, and key events of the Communist era, such as the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution under Mao Zedong and the capitalist reforms of Deng Xiaoping. The class will encourage reflection on China's encounter with modernity in order to better understand the complex reality of China today"

HIST 3080,"History of Post War Germany, from 1945 to the Present",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(HA-AS),,,"This course examines modern Germany in the aftermath of World War II. It compares the experiences of East and West Germany, their state forms and cultures. It explores the collapse of East Germany and the continuing effects of the hurried reunification. The course poses many questions, among them: How did the victorious allies try to administer the defeated land? How did Germans, East and West, try to come to grips with the Nazi past and its crimes? How does one reconstitute civil society after dictatorship and war? How did the communist regime function? Why did it fall? What are the main challenges Germany now faces in building a unified society and in regaining its place as a power in Europe?"

HIST 3181,"Living in an Uncertain World: Science, Technology, and Risk",4,Graded,Spring,,,"BSOC 3181, STS 3181",(HA-AS),,,"This course explores the history, sociology, and ethics of risk. In particular, we will focus on the complex and often ambiguous relationship between science, technology, and risk. A historical perspective shows how science and technology have generated risks while they have also played key roles in managing and solving those very risks. By examining several case studies, including 19th-century mining, the 1911 Triangle fire, nuclear science, the space shuttle disasters, asbestos litigation, Hurricane Katrina, and the contemporary financial crisis, we will consider how risk and ideas about risk have changed over time. By exploring different historical and cultural responses to risk, we will examine the sociopolitical dimensions of the definitions, perceptions, and management of risk both in the past and the present"
HIST 3221,Global Technologies of Identification: From Mugshots to Biometrics,4,Graded,,,,"SOC 3330, STS 3321",,,,"This course investigates the genealogy of the multiple technologies of identification that emerged in the last two centuries in different parts of the world.  Traditional forms of identification, such as tattoos, family names and physical features, along with other sophisticated technologies, i.e. fingerprinting, photography, and iris recognition, have played a crucial role in helping institutions to classify, identify, and monitor populations. Rather than following a lineal analysis, we will examine how these technologies emerged as the result of the transnational cooperation between East-West and South-North.  We will engage in current debates on how biometrics and identity cards are shaping the lives of millions of people worldwide, eroding or empowering them as citizens"
HIST 3411,Engineering in History,4,Graded,Spring,,,STS 3411,(HA-AS),,,"This course surveys the history of engineering in Europe and the United States from the Roman Empire to the present.

This course takes a historical, cultural, and social perspective of the rise of the Asian American Middle Class from the late nineteenth century to the current day. How did Asian Americans become part of the American middle class? Did the middle class experience racism differently compared to the working class? And although many Asian Americans strived to belong to the middle class, what are the limits of middle-class Asian American politics and lifestyle? We will cover topics such as immigration, imperialism, family politics, second generation, popular culture, model minority, education, and suicides"

We will focus on social as well as political themes including the Anglo-Russo-American Occupation of Iran, the 1979 Islamic Revolution, U.S.-Iranian relations, Iraq-Iran War, the Green Movement and the crisis of Islamic government, Images of the West in Iran, Modern Youth Culture, Gender segregation, and the struggle between modernity and traditionalism in contemporary Iran. We will watch selected Iranian documentary and feature films and draw on modern Persian literature but will approach them not as art forms but as reflections of major socio-economic, political, and religious phenomena in Iran's modern history. We will read and watch what the Iranians wrote and produced, read and watched, in order to view and explain Iran and its relations with the West through the Iranian eyes. We will examine how the Iranians perceived themselves and the others, how they viewed their own governments and the West, what issues inspired and shaped their outlook outside the official censorship during the period in question. All readings are in English translation and the films are with English subtitles. The course includes lectures deconstructing political, religious, and social evolution of modern Iran as well as regular class discussions where we will address the issues in question from a variety of perspectives"

HIST 4242,China's Encounter with Modernity,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ASIAN 4444, CAPS 4242, HIST 6242",(HA-AS),(GB),,"This course explores the processes and paradoxes of China's engagement with the modern world, focusing in particular on the Republican era, which lasted from 1912 to 1949. This period witnessed epochal changes in Chinese society and culture, ranging from the adoption of republican government and expansion of print culture to the promotion of women's rights and explosion of nationalism. Taken together, these and other changes can be said to signify the emergence of Chinese modernity. Yet what exactly do we mean by the term ""modernity""? And what makes modern China ""modern""? This class will seek to answer these questions by examining in detail the concrete developments that were occurring in different spheres of Chinese society in the early twentieth century and how these developments impacted the lives of individual Chinese, while also critically engaging the rich variety of ways that scholars have utilized the concept of modernity to understand and analyze them. In the process, we will learn to be alert to such issues as the potentially hegemonic aspects of ""modernity"" as a conceptual category, the ways in which modernity both integrates and transforms previously existing sociocultural patterns, and the inherent tension between the universalizing pretensions of modernity and the persistence of cultural particularism"

HIST 4503,European Temporal Imagination,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"GERST 4506, SHUM 4506",,,,"This course offers an exploration of the European temporal imagination, or the ways that questions and concerns about time have been integral to both cultural self-understanding and philosophical reflection. Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly ""universal"" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional contexts"
HIST 4509,Black in Time,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ASRC 4551, SHUM 4510",,,,"In the seminar ""Black in Time"" we will explore temporally specific, yet often interconnected iterations of blackness, in an attempt to account for how blackness has been experienced, conceptualized, articulated, practiced, politicized, historicized, and theorized across time and space. From the seventeenth-century West African Sahel, where shifting categories of blackness were articulated long before the advent of French colonial rule, to the twentieth century's globally interconnected black freedom struggles, we will plot out chronologies of blackness to better discern the conditions under which blackness becomes a meaningful, yet ever mutating signifier. We will also consider how and why time itself has become increasingly racialized through the emergence of new temporal categories, like post-Black and post-racial"

How have environmental historians (re)conceptualized the field as it has developed over the past half-century? What analytic concepts have environmental historians used to understand human-natural relations? Select themes include ecological imperialism, labor and work, body/environment, global environmental history, ""mainstreaming"" environmental history, and the Anthropocene"
HIST 6242,China’s Encounter with Modernity,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ASIAN 4444, CAPS 4242, HIST 4242",,,,"This course explores the processes and paradoxes of China's engagement with the modern world, focusing in particular on the Republican era, which lasted from 1912 to 1949. This period witnessed epochal changes in Chinese society and culture, ranging from the adoption of republican government and expansion of print culture to the promotion of women's rights and explosion of nationalism. Taken together, these and other changes can be said to signify the emergence of Chinese modernity. Yet what exactly do we mean by the term ""modernity""? And what makes modern China ""modern""? This class will seek to answer these questions by examining in detail the concrete developments that were occurring in different spheres of Chinese society in the early twentieth century and how these developments impacted the lives of individual Chinese, while also critically engaging the rich variety of ways that scholars have utilized the concept of modernity to understand and analyze them. In the process, we will learn to be alert to such issues as the potentially hegemonic aspects of ""modernity"" as a conceptual category, the ways in which modernity both integrates and transforms previously existing sociocultural patterns, and the inherent tension between the universalizing pretensions of modernity and the persistence of cultural particularism"

ILRHR 6400,Organizational Diversity and Inclusion,4,GradeNoAud,Fall or spring (seven-week session),,,,,,,"The diversity of the U.S. workforce has been steadily increasing over the last 50 years, and is projected to continue increasing significantly.  Although Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964 to prohibit employment discrimination based on an individual's race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, and other employment legislation has since been passed to prohibit discrimination based on other group characteristics such as age and disability status, claims of discrimination have been on the rise. This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for ""managing diversity"" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the ""business case"" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture. Finally, we will begin to explore the role of leaders and change agents in fostering diversity and inclusion"

We will begin the course with a discussion of the importance of this problem - for people with disabilities, employers, and for society at large - and then discuss employment legislation that has been passed in an effort to improve the employment of people with disabilities. A major component of this legislation has to do with reasonable accommodations, yet there continues to be insufficient understanding of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation and the likely costs associated with providing these accommodations, both of which we will cover in the third week of the course. We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities. We will spend the last week situating all of this within a broader discussion of diversity management in organizations, as people with disabilities have not consistently been included in the diversity agenda of organizations"

Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including ""binge drinking,"" ""sexual violence,"" and ""hazing."" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior.

Some continue to think of it as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people while others regard it is a Western inspired colonial project. Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel.

This course will take a more critical look at the historical interactions between Jewish immigration, United States industrialization, and processes of social and geographical mobility—all through the prism of New York's Lower East Side, first home for over 750,000 Jewish immigrants from Central and Eastern Europe, the Ottoman Empire and elsewhere between the mid-19th century and the 1920s.  We will compare the Jewish experience to that of other immigrants/migrants by considering social institutions as well as material and other cultural practices. We will examine interactions with the built environment —most especially the tenement—in Lower East Side culture. Special attention will be paid to immigrant labor movement politics including strikes, splits, and gender in the garment trade. From the perspective of the present, the course will examine how commemoration, heritage tourism and the selling of [immigrant] history intersect with gentrifying real estate in an ""iconic"" New York City neighborhood. Projects using the ILR's archives on the Triangle Fire and other topics are explicitly encouraged. This course counts as an out of college elective for B. Arch and M. Arch students"

LATA 1960,Modern Latin America,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 1960,(HA-AS),(GB),,"A survey of the social, political, cultural and economic history of Latin America from roughly 1800 to the present. Primary aim is to develop a mental map of the history of Latin America - of prominent themes issues; of historical eras and trajectories. Given the vastness of Latin America, and its somewhat arbitrary composition as an object of study, the approach of the course is thematic and chronological rather than regional. We will pay attention to a number of more specific and interconnected themes: the development of, and relationship between, economies and processes of state formation; the complex roles Britain and the U.S. have played in the region, but always with an appreciation for how Latin Americans have shaped their own histories and those of the U.S. and Britain; the ways in which non-elites - slaves, workers, peasants, among others - have shaped history; the politics of the production of history; and Latin America's 'situatedness' in a broader world.

What is it good for?  A political philosophy and approach to social organization that arose simultaneous with other grand  ""–isms,"" anarchism, perhaps more than any other idea and practice, has been condensed down by its critics and observers into a vague set of often contradictory caricatures. Is 'it' characterized by bohemian communities of nihilists, their rebellion culturally innovative but politically impotent, book-ended by Friedrich Nietzsche and Johnny Rotten?  Or is 'it' individualist libertarians who walk in the ideological footsteps of Murray Rothbard and Ayn Rand? Or collectivist anti-capitalists who tread the paths blazed by  Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin? Or, most famously, is 'it' a murky underworld of conspiratorial bomb throwers, held together less by bonds of solidarity than by a commitment to violence?  This seminar provides some relief from such limited and constraining perspectives by taking anarchism seriously as a social and political practice and tradition, one rooted largely in the left-wing critique of both the state and capitalism"

LATA 3015,Sweetness: How Sugar Built the Modern World,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 3010,(HA-AS),(GHB),,"Rice, wheat, and maize are examples of crops that sustained the civilizations in which they were cultivated for centuries. Sugar is different. Not only is sugar cane a relatively recent transplant, originating in Melanesia and South Asia, taken to the Middle East, and then cultivated extensively in the tropical regions of plantation America beginning in the 17th century. The sugar that it produces began as a luxury commodity and gradually became a household staple over the course of three centuries. This course examines key aspects of the transformation of sugar cane from plant to luxury commodity and then to staple, with particular emphasis on the impact that its cultivation and manufacturing had on the ecology, demography, diet, history, culture, economies, and politics of the Caribbean Basin. Sugar manufacturing in this region generated the enormous wealth that slave and indentured labor produced in and for transatlantic commerce for the three centuries that gave rise to the modern, western world. Given the importance of sugar at the time, sugar plantations were sites of some of the most ambitious experiments in science, industry, labor, and trade that the world had ever seen"

As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time.

Indeed, many cases are lost, won, or settled because of information gleaned at a deposition. Attorneys also often modify trial strategies because of a witness's performance at a deposition. Because depositions play such an important role in litigation, the majority of junior litigation attorneys can expect to deal with depositions in some manner from the very start of their careers.

LAW 6784,Professional Responsibility for LLMs,2,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course explores ethical issues relating to the legal profession. It has two aims—one immediate, the other more lofty. The immediate aim is to help prepare students for the MPRE. The loftier aim, by contrast, is to investigate the many ways in which one's professional responsibilities might conflict with one's personal obligations, self-interest or moral ideals. What should a lawyer do when her professional duties conflict with her financial interests, obligations to friends or family, or her religious beliefs? Why might it be justified for a lawyer to defend a client she knows to be guilty? Is it an excuse that one was ""just following orders""? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal opinions, as well as work by legal academics and moral philosophers. Students will take several smaller exams to test their mastery of central ethical rules governing the conduct of lawyers, and complete short writing assignments on the theoretical questions discussed in class"

LAW 6822,Social Science and the Law,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course examines the relationship of social science to law, focusing on the growing use of social science in the legal system. Over the past several decades, increasing numbers of social scientists have conducted systematic research on the operation of law and legal institutions. At the same time, social scientists themselves are testifying as experts in increasing numbers, encouraging lawyers and judges at both the trial and appellate levels to rely on social science evidence to decide cases. Social science research is also used as a tool in law reform. The aim of the course is to develop a critical analysis of these uses of social science in law and litigation. Are social scientists asking the right questions? Are lawyers, judges, legislators, and legal reformers using social science findings appropriately? Is the law's increasing reliance on social science problematic or advantageous -- or both?"

MEDVL 2130,Cultures of the Middle Ages,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 2742,(CA-AS),(HB),,"Topic: Medieval Frontier Societies  It's bad enough to run up against a border: at least you know where you stand. The frontier, however -- that fuzzy, murky zone that envelops the border while making its precise contours invisible -- is far more ambiguous, dangerous ground to tread. People, ideas, and other contraband criss-cross it; men (and sometimes women) make their own law; cultures clash and conspire together. At the margins of Europe -- Ireland, Wales, Scandinavia, Poland, Germany, the Low Countries, Spain, Sicily, the Levant -- medieval people discovered what every Trekkie knows: final frontiers, spaces of both oppression and opportunity. This course will explore some of the exchanges, friendly and otherwise, that took place at the edges of the medieval world, seeding many of the most radical developments which shaped the modern world"

Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth.

How has music in Africa provided a unique position of individual and communal articulation with (post)colonialism, nationalism, crisis, and global representation? How has music worked to empower or disempower certain populations, and what are the implications of its use in the interest of politics? How do frameworks such as cosmopolitanism and Afropolitanism expand or limit our understandings of popular musical cultures in Africa?

Taxes have a direct impact on cash flow and often divert 30 to 40 percent of the firm's pretax cash flow to the government, effectively making the government the single largest stakeholder in many firms.

NBA 5140,Ethics and Corporate Culture,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"In the high-pressure worlds of business and law, all too often good people do bad things.  In many cases, the unethical behavior is due in part to a toxic corporate culture. The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where ""only results matter,"" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior.

NBA 5200,Retail Operations,1.5,GradeNoAud,Fall,,,,,,,"This course is designed as a half-semester elective course for MBA students.

It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures"

Despite its success in establishing the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism, which also sought to ""normalize"" Jewish collective life and provide a safe haven from persecution for the Jews, has encountered multiple challenges from within and without. Some continue to think of it as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people while others regard it is a Western inspired colonial project. Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel. The course also considers the phenomenon of post-Zionism in Israeli historiography as well as Zionism's difficulty in coming to terms with the idea and reality that two peoples rather than one live in the land west of the Jordan"

In some cases, the verses do not seem to fit the context; in others, they violate standard rules of Arabic grammar. Some in the Muslim tradition take these verses as evidence of the miraculous nature of the language of the Quran whose secrets only Allah knows. A number of modern scholars, particularly in the West, have tried to understand them by reference to Semitic languages, particularly Syriac and Hebrew, or by reference to Christian and Jewish traditions, which had a substantial influence on the language of the Quran. Some scholars have gone so far as to offer alternative readings of the Quranic text or to propose emendations.  Applying the tools of modern linguistic analysis, we will examine a sample of these passages, read their standard Muslim interpretation (tafsiir), identify grammatical and textual problems and propose alternative interpretations that arguably produce a semantically more coherent and grammatically sounder text"

Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined. Corporate governance mechanisms include hostile takeovers, insider trading, outside directors on the board, the monitoring role of institutional investors, audits, and executive compensation plans.

More recently, many have endorsed Turing's proposal that the mind is a computer. Why is this idea attractive and what exactly is a computer? Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway? Could a machine ever count as a person and make choices based on its own free will? Is it really so clear that we have this kind of free will?"

PHIL 6951,Aesthetic Theory: The End of Art,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARTH 6560, GERST 6560",,,,"This course investigates the emergence of aesthetics as its own philosophical discipline at the end of the eighteenth century.  In a first phase, we will examine the rationalist articulation of aesthetics in Baumgarten's work and the empiricist theory of taste, particularly Burke's Enquiry.  Drawing on the findings of these two traditions, Kant's Critique of Judgment (1790) inaugurated a preoccupation in German philosophy around 1800 with the philosophical status of the beautiful and of art.  Especially in Romantic theory and practice, art was meant to provide a solution to the philosophical dilemmas in the wake of Kant's critical philosophy.  However, already in Hegel's Phenomenology, and more explicitly in the Encyclopedia and the Lectures on Aesthetics, art lost this elevated position vis-à-vis philosophy.  Taking this observation as a guiding thread, the main part of the course is structured around in-depth readings that may include Kant, Schiller, Schelling, the Schlegels, Novalis, Hölderlin, and Hegel.  Further readings may include writings by contemporary philosophers and theoreticians--such as Adorno, Allison, Danto, Deleuze, Derrida, Ginsborg, Guyer, Lyotard et al.--whose work on aesthetics takes its starting point from the philosophical issues surrounding the emergence of aesthetic theory only to transcend these historical confines and formulate contemporary positions on the status of the aesthetic and of art.  The following questions will be addressed: What are the conditions for the move from the subjective judgment of taste (Kant) to objective beauty (Romantics, Hegel)?  How is the relation of art and nature reconceived by the Romantics?  What is the relation of aesthetic theory and the history of art?  Is philosophy the end of art?"

We will examine both practices themselves - techniques of meditation and contemplation - religious ways of using intellect, forms of chant and ritual, and the dynamics through which these have left a wider mark on South Asian civilization. These dynamics include not only the evident reverberations of practice in philosophical reflection and socioreligious institutions, but also wide-ranging processes of stylization, elaboration, and popularization found throughout South Asian culture. In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts. To keep the interaction between internal practice and broader world views central, we will examine both Hindu and Buddhist sources, consistently examining the ways in which similar practices are given distinct shapes by the two religious traditions"

After that, we will look at whether religious belief might be rational without theoretical proof or empirical evidence, whether religious experience is an intelligible notion, and whether the real-world fact of religious diversity has philosophical implications. Time permitting, we will conclude by reflecting on two prominent religious ideas: miracles and the afterlife. Course readings will be taken from both historical and contemporary sources"

Rather than thinking of Judaism as static and easily definable, we will explore a history that is complex and dynamic. Over the three thousand year period that we will be studying, individuals and groups who identified themselves as Israelites or Jews developed a remarkable variety of beliefs and practices in conversation and in competition with other groups, including Christianity and Islam. We will examine trends and key moments of this process in order to understand how continuity and change, the construction of identity, and the competition for legitimacy have shaped our contemporary ideas about what Judaism is. We will approach this subject from a historical perspective, analyzing material evidence and reading texts from each period in translation, and from a religious studies perspective, carefully observing how the meaning of categories such as religion and Judaism change over time. A better understanding of these changes can help us better to appreciate difference and conflict both ancient and contemporary"

Despite its success in establishing the State of Israel in 1948, Zionism, which also sought to ""normalize"" Jewish collective life and provide a safe haven from persecution for the Jews, has encountered multiple challenges from within and without. Some continue to think of it as the national liberation movement of the Jewish people while others regard it is a Western inspired colonial project. Originating largely as a radical rejection of both traditional Jewish religious life and the Jews' diaspora in favor of modern nationalism, since 1967 Zionism has witnessed religious-nationalist fervor and a Jewish diaspora increasingly interested in or disinterested with the state of Israel. The course also considers the phenomenon of post-Zionism in Israeli historiography as well as Zionism's difficulty in coming to terms with the idea and reality that two peoples rather than one live in the land west of the Jordan"

We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did.

The seminar explores the contributions that a literary-theory perspective can make to an understanding of the globalized present, by retracing the genealogy of ""the knowledge society"" in the development of colonial ""politics of knowledge"" and their ulterior dissection by anticolonial, de-colonial and postcolonial critiques. Going back to the Orientalist invention of the comparative study of languages, we trace the relation of poetics to politics through successive stages of scholarship and intellectual struggle, and study the power of literary critique in cultural hegemony, past and present. Readings will possibly include Jones, Renan, Saussure, Said, Lyotard, Jameson, Dirlik, Spivak, Apter, among others"

Two main questions guide the course: what are the key patterns of argument related to time in the Western tradition? How did scientific knowledge, cross-cultural encounters and methodological disputes shape or change these patterns? The eighteenth and nineteenth centuries were a period of rapid temporal expansion in both extent and detail: geology shifted the scale of time, and chronological work propelled claims for a truly ""universal"" history.  Departing from these developments, the course explores how temporal ideas have functioned within and shaped different disciplinary and institutional contexts"

How in particular did anticipation of rights bearing European publics, enshrining post Enlightenment values, implicate/disturb the linear narrative of nation states emerging from the ruins of empire? We will explore the temporal entanglements between racialization logics of empire and nation, one demanding difference the other, sameness.  What are the logics and ambivalences of racialization when time of empire requiring difference is also the time of nation, requiring sameness?  What are implications of such an entanglement for postcolonial nations? How do inherited racializations set limits on postcolonial aspirations for homogeneity?  How does postcolonial homogeneity also produce difference in demarcation of the rights bearing subject of the nation?"

From the seventeenth-century West African Sahel, where shifting categories of blackness were articulated long before the advent of French colonial rule, to the twentieth century's globally interconnected black freedom struggles, we will plot out chronologies of blackness to better discern the conditions under which blackness becomes a meaningful, yet ever mutating signifier. We will also consider how and why time itself has become increasingly racialized through the emergence of new temporal categories, like post-Black and post-racial"
SHUM 4511,Musical Timekeeping and the Security State,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,MUSIC 4452,,,,"This seminar will draw on continental philosophy, critical theory, musicology and composers' writings, to investigate historical relationships between strategies of musical timekeeping (conductor, clock, score, rehearsal) and forms of political power, such as those Michel Foucault designated as 'pastoral', 'governmental', and 'disciplinary'. We will examine musical innovators' theater of resistance towards complete synchronization and how they have indicated different ways for a group to move through time together, from Schoenberg and Stravinsky to Miles Davis, John Cage, Japanese noise compositions, and post-minimalist repetition. Each week will pair close readings of theoretical texts with close listenings of relevant music. Readings include: Nietzsche, Adorno, Bataille, Foucault, Agamben, Gilroy, Hegarty, Andriessen, Feldman, Olaniyan, Born, Beckles Willson.

These theories, which are covered in the first two segments of the course, provide some insight into where society is going and what challenges have emerged along the way.  In the third segment of the course, we will look more closely at the role of individuals and everyday interaction in the genesis of social phenomena.  We will explore theories about what motivates individuals' social behavior, the role of rationality and emotion, how the micromechanics of interpersonal contact can shape larger society, and the subtle links between biological and social processes.  In the final segment of the course, we will explore complex webs that emerge through social actors' connections to each other, and how these network structures have been shaped by the various processes that were examined during the semester"

SOC 2190,Introduction to Economic Sociology,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"What is the driving force behind economic growth? How do people find jobs? Does culture matter for economic action? What exactly is a market? Why is there a concentration of high-tech firms in Silicon Valley? Why has entrepreneurial capitalism emerged in China? These are some of the questions that this course will explore through the theoretical lens of economic sociology. Economic sociology has sought to understand the beliefs, norms, and institutions that shape and drive the global economy. It has sought to extend the sociological approach to the study of economic life by studying the interactions between social structure and economic action. The systematic application of sociological reasoning to explain economic action involves analysis of the ways in which social networks, norms, and institutions matter in economic transactions. The goal of this course is to provide an introduction to economic sociology as an approach and research program to understand and explain the relationship between economy and society in the modern era"

This course considers development as an evolving world project and from the perspective of its social and ecological impact: asking questions about costs and benefits of economic growth, about the global context (geo-political, institutional, production, consumption, and discursive relations), and the sustainability of various models. We relate development trends in the South/Third World with those in the North/First World. We also examine shared, global issues, such as the environment, human rights, security, and their condition in different parts of the world. In examining development historically, we encourage students to situate trends shaping the twenty-first century world, and how they can contribute, as global citizens, to the ongoing debate about how to reformulate development as an inclusive an empowering social process.  This course combines Lectures with discussion, and uses films and section discussions to promote reflection on diversity of cultures and understandings of human development. It also includes a special component (access by instructor permission), in conjunction with Cornell's Writing in the Majors Program.

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies.

We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa.

SOC 3160,Social Context and Health,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course examines how the social world gets ""under the skin."" We'll examine the associations between various aspects of social context – including stratification and inequality, social networks and support, and social environments – and physical health. There are two main components of this course. First, we'll read and discuss previous research on the health effects of social status, patient-physician interactions, employment/work, stress, social networks, social support, loneliness, culture and religion, and the neighborhood context. We'll consider both qualitative and quantitative research on social life and health, with an eye toward identifying the strengths and weaknesses of various methodological approaches and gaps in current knowledge. The second component of this course is focused on the development of your own research regarding the relationship between social context and health. You'll explore this using data from a population-based social survey. Class instruction for this portion of the course will cover research question development, the statistical analysis of survey data, and social scientific writing.

We will examine a variety of theoretical perspectives used in the analysis of population- environmental relationships, and will consider how a range of forces (technology, institutions, culture) might mediate these linkages. Focus on population will expand beyond traditional emphasis on population size to also consider the role that population composition and other population processes play in driving environmental change (including climate, land-use, water, energy resources), and how this change, in turn, impacts human populations. We will also raise some of the methodological challenges that arise when studying these linkages, and students will work with secondary data to conduct their own analyses on population-environment questions. By the end of the course, students should have the theoretical and methodological tools to better connect with public debates around issues of environmental justice, sustainability, conservation, and population policy"

Rather than following a lineal analysis, we will examine how these technologies emerged as the result of the transnational cooperation between East-West and South-North.  We will engage in current debates on how biometrics and identity cards are shaping the lives of millions of people worldwide, eroding or empowering them as citizens"

SOC 3650,Sociology of Disasters,3,Graded,Spring,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"Disasters are usually sudden events that result in catastrophic loss of life and/or property. They are often described using terms like disorder, chaos, and panic - descriptions which belie the highly socially structured nature of disasters. This course takes a closer look at disaster situations using a sociological lens. We will examine the social elements of several disasters, including the sinking of Titanic, the collapse of the World Trade Center towers on 9/11, Hurricane Katrina, and others. Through these cases, students will learn about (1) the social-psychological and collective dynamics that govern behavior in disaster situations, (2) the role social networks and organizations play in disaster occurrence, response and recovery, and especially (3) the role of social disadvantage in shaping vulnerability to and mortality risk in disasters"

SOC 6020,Linear Models,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PAM 6820,,,,"This course provides an in-depth examination of linear modeling. We begin with the basics of linear regression, including estimation, statistical inference, and model assumptions. We then review several tools for diagnosing violations of statistical assumptions and what to do when things go wrong, including dealing with outliers, missing data, omitted variables, and weights. Finally, we will explore extensions of the linear regression model, including models for categorical outcomes and hierarchical linear modeling. While statistical modeling is the focus of the course, we proceed with the assumption that models are only as good as the theoretical and substantive knowledge behind them. Thus, in covering the technical material, we will spend considerable time discussing the link between substantive knowledge and statistical practice. The course is designed primarily for graduate students in sociology"
SOC 6160,Survey Methods,2,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course will provide a foundation in the fundamentals of social survey design, implementation, and analysis for graduate students who wish to conduct survey research or analyze survey data. We will begin by reviewing theories underlying social scientific survey research, and then consider principles of survey design and administration including sampling methodology, questionnaire construction, internal and external validity, field administration, and interviewer effects. We will review data management and analytic techniques of scaling and scoring, assessing data quality and measurement error, coping with missing data and response bias, weighting, and adjusting for clustered sampling designs. Throughout the course, we will review publicly available social survey data and consider the promise and challenges of new survey methods including web- and smartphone-based surveys, wiki surveys, and mixed-mode data collection"

SOC 6350,Network Sampling and Network Structure,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"Network sampling methods provide means for drawing probability samples of hidden and hard-to-reach populations. These populations are difficult to sample using standard survey research methods because they lack a sampling frame, that is, an exhaustive list of population members from which the sample can be drawn and constructing a sampling frame is not feasible due to the closed nature of the populations networks or associated factors. Populations with these characteristics are important to studies of public health (e.g., drug users and commercial sex workers), public policy (e.g., immigrants and the homeless), and arts and culture (e.g., jazz musicians and aging artists). This course will survey the use of network-based approaches to sample populations and study the structure of social networks. The focus will range from initial work on biased network theory, through various approaches based on snowball sampling, the ""random-walk"" approach, adaptive sampling, and link-tracing designs, to a principal focus on respondent-driven sampling (RDS), including the analytics underlying that method, operational procedures, recent work extending the method, the potential for use of RDS to study the structure of very large social networks, and open areas in which further work is continuing and alternative formulations are emerging"

This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa.

Focus on population will expand beyond traditional emphasis on population size to also consider the role that population composition and other population processes play in driving environmental change (including climate, land-use, water, energy resources), and how this change, in turn, impacts human populations. We will also raise some of the methodological challenges that arise when studying these linkages, and students will work with secondary data to conduct their own analyses on population-environment questions. By the end of the course, students should have the theoretical and methodological tools to better connect with public debates around issues of environmental justice, sustainability, conservation, and population policy"

Leonardo was an extraordinary thinker, scientist, and engineer as well as artist. Michelangelo invented grandiose projects for ambitious patrons and created a novel visual language with parallels to his poetry, and in his later years, profoundly spiritual images. Raphael, the consummate court artist, antiquarian, and archaeologist, produced a new classical style. Leonardo and Michelangelo pioneered new approaches to the study and representation of the human body. They deployed wit and humor and reinvented the grotesque from ancient art, and all influenced the proliferation of erotic art. Biographies presented them as geniuses, leading the Florentine sculptor Cellini to model himself in his autobiography on a larger-than-life Michelangelo.

We begin with politically-charged Montmartre cabarets—Le Chat Noir, Moulin Rouge—where shadow theater, acrobats, and quadrille dancers inspired the street posters of Toulouse-Lautrec, Steinlin, and Vallotton. We follow their influence to James Ensor's Ostend carnivals and Les XX (The Twenty), the painters' coalition dedicated to the Belgian Workers Party, and then look at fin-de-siècle print culture through Redon's haunting ""noirs,"" lithographic albums inspired by Poe's tales of horror. We consider the Pont Aven Symbolists' turn from material to dream worlds visualized through stained glass and medieval tapestry; the close ties between Neo-impressionist painters and anarchist art critics; the Nabis (Prophets) pre-cinematic crowd scenes and the Lumière Brothers; and why the Nabis Vuillard and Bonnard abandoned their easels for costume and set design at the Théâtre d'Art. We consider the 1889 exposition universelle and the pavilions that fueled mass colonial fantasies and Gauguin's departure for Tahiti. Woven throughout are larger performances of decadence, crowds, and hysteria as modernity, and tensions between industrial life and utopic longing that led Symbolists to read Monet's Giverny grainstacks series as cosmic orbs, ""the terrestrial life of the globe and the course of earth through space."" We will see the epoch illumined by marvel—electric lighting, phantasmagoria, Jules Verne's voyages, and Méliès' enchanted cinema"
