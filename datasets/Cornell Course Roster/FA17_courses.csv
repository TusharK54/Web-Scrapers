AAS 2100,South Asian Diaspora,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ANTHR 2410,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This interdisciplinary course (with an emphasis in anthropology) will introduce students to the multiple routes/roots, lived experiences, and imagined worlds of South Asians who have traveled to various lands at different historical moments spanning Fiji, South Africa, Mauritius, Britain, Malaysia, United States, Trinidad, and even within South Asia itself such as the Tamil-speaking population of Sri Lanka. The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could ""culture"" serve as the basis for a shared identity?"

What are the relationships between Asian American digital media and neoliberalism/capitalism? Alternatively, how do these digital lives rupture or resist imperialist structures either in practice or theory? What futures and memories do online Asian American performances carve out?"

This failure is due to the inability of national policy to imagine a world beyond a boundary drawn by the formative capitalist ideas of property, production, and profit. The course will begin by discussing the historical origin and continuing force of these ideas while raising questions about their limits. Then it will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance. The alternatives we will query come from a range of Indigenous writers of fiction, poetry, and theory, who locate themselves in Native American (north and south), Aboriginal, and Maori communities"

Therefore this class will examine the history and contemporary role of immigration in the U.S. political system. The class will focus on two aspects of immigration: First, a historical examination of immigration policy from the founding of the country all the way forward to the current debate over immigration reform. Second, we will evaluate and assess the political incorporation and political participation of immigrant groups in the U.S. and determine whether immigrants are being incorporated, and if not, why?

In the face of a largely male rabbinic elite, they have created new models of ritual, communal leadership, and textual interpretation both within and outside existing Jewish institutions and denominations. How have women mobilized embodied practice and knowledge in efforts to reinterpret, reclaim, and reinvent Judaism? How have these changes reverberated in communities that explicitly reject feminism? And what can these women teach us about religion, gender, and sexuality in America more broadly? This course will engage the fields of religion; gender, sexuality, and the body; textual and material culture; and feminism within the context of American Jewish life. The course will focus the contemporary United States, but will also explore layers of Jewish tradition from ancient to modern times and will consider women's practices in Israel as well. Key themes will include the relationships between gender and power; bodies, texts and objects; individual Jewish practices and communal identity; biology and theology; secularism and spirituality; and the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and conversion. Exploring how competing visions of Judaism reflect alternative understandings of gender and sexuality, we will probe the meaning of gender equality, how the Jewish experience compares to that of members of other faiths in America, and the challenge that these diverse Jewish projects pose to the American project of secularism"

AMST 2664,What's Colonial About Early America?,4,Graded,Fall,,,HIST 2664,(HA-AS),(HB),,"Many Americans envision the colonial period as a relatively quaint and benign time dominated by Pocahontas, the Pilgrims, and provinciality.  Pairing the term ""colonial"" with ""America"" also tends to render the nearly-three centuries between Europeans' arrival in the western hemisphere and the Declaration of Independence as the prehistory of the United States when in fact multiple colonial regimes existed in North America at any time prior to 1776.  This course investigates the rich, complex, and violent history of early America with the objective of a fresh appreciation of its ""colonial"" aspects – natural resource extraction, territorial expropriation and displacement of indigenous peoples, exploitation of enslaved labor, and the imposition of juridical authority over ""settled"" spaces – with an eye toward a better understanding of the larger patterns of domination (however incomplete) in which the emergent international state system and global capitalism creating imbalances of wealth and power that persist to this day.  In addition to exploration of familiar sites like the thirteen Anglo-American colonies, the course will venture into less well-known areas (including those outside contemporary national American boundaries) to enhance students' appreciation of the diversity of human in experience in early America via comparative analysis"

AMST 2726,Culture and Identity in Modern America: The 19th Century,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,HIST 2726,(HA-AS),(HB),,"The nineteenth century changed everything in the United States: it gave us what we think of as modern American culture.  The nation went from rural, agrarian, economically dependent, partially enslaved, and otherwise relatively homogeneous, to urban, industrial, economically powerful, emancipated, and relatively heterogeneous.  Americans embraced corporate capitalism and consumerism at the end of the century, and that, in particular, has had a lasting impact. This course examines all those changes, with an emphasis on the development of cultural and intellectual diversity in the United States. Key topics and themes include: literature; slavery, abolition, and racial issues; the women's movement; Darwinism and Social Darwinism; professionalization; individualism; landscape and environment; class and capitalism; responses to industrialization and modernization; expansion and the western frontier; and visual culture. We'll focus on both ideas and individuals, using mostly primary documents but contextualizing and cross-examining them as we go. Perhaps the overarching theme is the contestation of culture: we'll explore the ways in which individuals both shape and are shaped by their society—the ways in which they both reinforce and resist its pressures. Of course, there is no one definitive characteristic of our cultural heritage, but in this course we will make a concerted effort to consider what people mean when they say ""America.""  We'll try especially hard to see how certain 19th-century definitions of American culture have carried through to the 21st century"

B. White, C. S. Lewis, Sendak, Silverstein, Mildred Taylor, and Bette Greene. We'll also encounter a variety of critical models—psychoanalytic, materialist, feminist, structuralist—that scholars have employed to explain the variety and importance of children's literature. Finally, we will consider how the idea of ""the child"" has evolved over this period"

The second half inquires into the U.S. and American engagement of different world regions and civilizations: Europe, Russia, North America, Latin America, China, Japan, India and the Middle East. U.S. hard power and American soft power find expression in far-reaching processes of American-infused globalization and U.S.-centered anti-Americanism reverberating around the world.

Then it will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance.

We will both evoke and complicate the contrast between New York and Los Angeles by mapping the intersections of each city with cinema. We explore how the urban experience has been said to give rise to particular cinematic forms and the ways in which cinematic styles may be translated into urban design. Topics may include density and sprawl; place and creativity; class and ethnicity; race and gender; culture and commercialism; industrial and media economies; and insularism and cosmopolitanism. Screenings will include documentary, experimental, and commercial films and cover such genres as early actualities, city symphonies, film noir, science fiction, etc. Readings will be drawn from theories and histories of film, urbanism, and architecture"

ANTHR 2010,Archaeology of the Ancient Near East,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ARKEO 2010, NES 2610",(HA-AS),(GHB),,"The Near East is often defined by ""firsts"": the first cities, writing, and complex societies. Archaeology has long looked to the region for explanations of the origins of civilization. The Middle East has also long been a place where archaeology and politics are inextricably intertwined, from Europe's 19th century appropriation of the region's heritage, to the looting and destruction of antiquities in recent wars in Syria and Iraq. This introductory course moves between past and present. It offers a survey of 10,000 years of human history, from the appearance of farming villages to the dawn of imperialism, while also engaging current debates on the contemporary stakes of archaeology in the Middle East. Covering Iraq, Syria, Turkey, Iran, and the Caucasus, our focus is on past material worlds and the modern politics in which they are entangled"

We will review important archaeological sites such as Chaco Canyon, Cahokia, Lamoka Lake, and the Little Bighorn battlefield. A principal focus will be on major transformations in lifeways such as the adoption of agriculture, the development of political-economic hierarchies, and the disruptions that accompanied the arrival of Europeans to the continent"
ANTHR 2245,Health and Disease in the Ancient World,3,Graded,Fall,,,ARKEO 2245,(HA-AS),,,"The history of humankind is also a history of health and disease; the rise of agricultural societies, ancient cities, and colonial empires had wide-ranging effects on diet and nutrition, the spread of infectious diseases, and occurrence of other health conditions. This history has also been shaped by complex interactions between environment, technology, and society. Using archaeological, environmental, textual, and skeletal evidence, we will survey major epidemiological transitions from the Paleolithic to the age of European conquest. We will also examine diverse cultural experiences of health, illness, and the body. How do medical practices from ""pre-modern"" socieites, such as the medieval Islamic world and the Inca Empire, challenge dominant narratives of scientific development?

This course investigates Egyptian interactions with the Greco-Roman world and the changing Greek and Roman attitudes towards Egypt. Readings will cover subjects including the earliest Egyptian-Aegean trade, Herodotus' accounts of Egypt, Greco-Macedonian kings on the throne of the pharaohs, Roman perceptions of the notorious Cleopatra, the worship of Egyptian gods in the Greco-Roman world, and the incorporation of Egypt into the Roman empire (among other topics). Through an examination of Greek and Roman representations of Egypt, we will investigate how Greeks and Romans conceived of their own societies and cultural identities. Finally, we will also address images of Egypt in modern popular culture; how have Greco-Roman portrayals of Egypt helped shape today's view of the Pharaonic world?"

The course will begin with the labor migrations of the 1830s and continue up to the present period. The primary exercise will be to compare and contrast the varied expressions of the South Asian Diaspora globally in order to critically evaluate this transnational identity. Thus, we will ask what, if any, are the ties that bind a fifth-generation Indo-Trinidadian whose ancestor came to the New World as an indentured laborer or ""coolie"" in the mid-19th century to labor in the cane fields, to a Pakistani medical doctor who migrated to the United States in the late 1980s. If Diaspora violates a sense of identity based on territorial integrity, then could ""culture"" serve as the basis for a shared identity?"

In the face of a largely male rabbinic elite, they have created new models of ritual, communal leadership, and textual interpretation both within and outside existing Jewish institutions and denominations. How have women mobilized embodied practice and knowledge in efforts to reinterpret, reclaim, and reinvent Judaism? How have these changes reverberated in communities that explicitly reject feminism? And what can these women teach us about religion, gender, and sexuality in America more broadly? This course will engage the fields of religion; gender, sexuality, and the body; textual and material culture; and feminism within the context of American Jewish life. The course will focus the contemporary United States, but will also explore layers of Jewish tradition from ancient to modern times and will consider women's practices in Israel as well. Key themes will include the relationships between gender and power; bodies, texts and objects; individual Jewish practices and communal identity; biology and theology; secularism and spirituality; and the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and conversion. Exploring how competing visions of Judaism reflect alternative understandings of gender and sexuality, we will probe the meaning of gender equality, how the Jewish experience compares to that of members of other faiths in America, and the challenge that these diverse Jewish projects pose to the American project of secularism"
ANTHR 2644,Introduction to Judaism,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"JWST 2644, NES 2644, RELST 2644",(HA-AS),(GHB),,"Jewish communities have been established, flourished and often struggled for millennia, throughout much of the world, and in vital contact with a vast range of other peoples and cultures. This course examines the constant and dynamic tension between that which unites Jews in all these different times and places, and that which makes every Jew a person of his or her own time and place. Our whirlwind tour will take us from ancient Israel, through Babylonia and the world of early Islam, into the medieval origins of Ashkenazi Jewry, down to Ottoman North Africa, and all the way across the Indian Ocean. We will learn how Jewish and other diaspora communities overcome challenges to maintain their distinctive identities, how to engage critically with the ways contemporary scholars the records of these far-flung communities, and how to generate their own critical questions"

This course examines the political context of the study of the past, and the uses to which accounts of the past have been put in the present. Archaeology is often implicated in nationalist claims to territory, or claims of ethnic, racial, or religious superiority. Museum exhibits and other presentations to the public always have an agenda, consciously or otherwise. Archaeologists are increasingly required to interact with descendent communities, often in the context of postcolonial tensions. The antiquities trade and the protection of archaeological sites connects archaeologists to commercial and law enforcement sectors. We will also consider the internal politics of the practice of archaeology in various settings, including the implications of the funding sources that support archaeological work. This course is open to students of archaeology, socio-cultural anthropology, history, and other disciplines with an interest in the past"
ANTHR 3428,"Conflict, Dispute Resolution, and Law in Cultural Context",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"Rule-making and dispute resolution are integral aspects of social reality in any culture. The ways in which conflict is treated and interpreted -- to be then deflected or resolved -- articulate with other cultural domains such as religion, politics, and economics as part of the material and symbolic processes that enable sociocultural interaction. At issue then are the formal and processual means that the treatment of conflict takes in different societies. These means constitute frames for the definition of social experience that are used by social actors in the interpretation of events within the terms of an overriding sociocultural logic that is in turn refigured by these interpretive frames"
ANTHR 3437,"Global Fantasies, Global Realities, Global Nightmares",3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ANTHR 6437,(SBA-AS),(GHB),,"This course offers a synthetic perspective on a spectrum of currently troubling phenomena -- the rise of authoritarian populism, growing inequality, racism, misogyny, nationalism, war. In particular, it links macro-scale and historical theories regarding global processes (e.g., ""world systems,"" ""globalization""), on the one hand, and the more intimate correlates of these macro forces shaping individual experience, on the other.  Drawing from anthropology as well as from cognate disciplines (political economy, history, and psychology), the course surveys and assesses both case studies of phenomena such as the self-delusion of the oppressed, the narcissism of dictators, and how the making and remaking of social identities relate to world economic cycles.  Course readings highlight how fantasy, imagination, hope and fear figure crucially in people's apprehensions of the contemporary world. "

This course will explore issues in the cultural construction of the United States as a ""pluralistic"" society. We will look at the ideological context for the production of a cultural profile predicted upon ideas that are intrinsic to American images of identity such as individualism, freedom, and equality and the way these are applied in practice. The course readings will include historic documents and accounts, popular writing, and recent ethnographies on the United States"

ANTHR 4014,Polluted Senses,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,SHUM 4614,,,,"Nothing is more essential to humans than everyday sensory experiencing. We feel the rain on our skin, or smell the stench of garbage, and decide what to do. Our senses clue us into possibilities and potential dangers. But are our sensory experiences universal? No. We have ample evidence that what people consider as their senses varies widely across societies, cultures, and national borders. Sensory experiencing also changes over time, with new technologies. This seminar engages the global diversity of sensory apprehension, honing in on multiple sensory forms of 'pollution' (aesthetic, political, ecological, religious, legal and cultural), and emerging conceptual and experiential approaches to ""polluted senses."" Concepts and enactments of pollution affect what is communally sacred, social, and environmental, but also what is degenerative, contaminated, or corrupt such as health or moral crises and social, political conflicts"

From prehistory to the present, the manipulation of clay to form pottery and other synthetic objects has transformed domains of human experience from the quotidian to the consequential. This course addresses the theories and methods that equip archaeologists to make deductions about past societies on the basis of ceramic evidence. We will examine such topics as methods of organizing and classifying ceramic data, aspects of pottery production, pottery style, form, and function, techniques of instrumental analysis, and frameworks for the interpretation of pottery that allow archaeologists to arrive at some understanding of social, political, and economic lifeways. This course entails both seminar-based instruction and hands-on laboratory skills"

This course teaches students how to identify all 206 bones and 32 teeth of the human skeleton, in both complete and fragmentary states. Students will also learn osteological methods for establishing a biological profile (age-at-death, sex, stature, and biological affinity) and documenting skeletal trauma and pathological lesions. Hands-on laboratory training will be supplemented by case studies that demonstrate the importance of human osteology for criminal investigations in the present and the study of health and violence in the past. The ethics of working with human remains are also discussed"

In the process, we will explore the principles, theories and epistemologies informing various paradigms in qualitative research. What does it mean to do interpretive research? What do feminist and critical ethnographies look like? What are critical race methodologies? What does it mean to think with performativity, power, deconstruction, desire or decoloniality? We will also examine dilemmas and issues concerning ethics, informed consent, researcher positionality and relationships, and writing and reporting"

We will explore the post-colonial as a dynamic space that both plays off of and refigures the complicated dynamics of colonialism. The postcolonial challenges the dichotomies through which colonial power moved: western/indigenous, white/black, modern/traditional, global/local, developed/underdeveloped, and science/non-science. At the same time, it confronts the ways in which colonial histories are still embodied in institutions, identities, environments, and landscapes. Techno-scientific knowledge and practice have both enacted colonial divisions and been called on in post-colonial struggles. How them might we understand the work of scientific knowledge and practice in the kinds of hegemonies and struggles that shape our world today? We will explore this question by examining the way that technoscience is performed-by scientists, development workers, activists, government officials, and others. The class will pay particular attention to the located processes through which claims to the universal or global emerge. In addition by considering controversies over the environment, medicine, and indigenous knowledge, we will consider the effects of such claims"

Drawing on the fields of anthropology of education and feminist studies, we examine how girls and young women construct gender identities and ways of knowing through prisms of race, ethnicity, sexuality, class, language, nation and citizenship. Second, we inquire into how gendered notions of development and state sanctioned forms of structural and symbolic violence, impact young women's educational experiences and opportunities, and how they in turn respond. Lastly, we consider young women as learners who craft their own lives and literacies across borders and diverse spaces of home, school, community, and peer group"

Archaeology is often implicated in nationalist claims to territory, or claims of ethnic, racial, or religious superiority. Museum exhibits and other presentations to the public always have an agenda, consciously or otherwise. Archaeologists are increasingly required to interact with descendent communities, often in the context of postcolonial tensions. The antiquities trade and the protection of archaeological sites connects archaeologists to commercial and law enforcement sectors.

Over the course of the twentieth century, photography is enriched by new developments: its use as a modernist and experimental art form, in social documentary and photojournalism, in propaganda, in advertising and fashion. In recent decades, photography has assumed a centrality in the practice of conceptual postmodern art, and is currently undergoing a major transformation in the age of digital media"

This semester we will investigate the extraordinary global reach of the Dutch to both east and west, resulting in trade and luxury goods, new knowledge of peoples, flora, and fauna—considered marvelous—as well as encounters with and portrayals of difference. As they leave their marks on the visual, we will explore Africa and the African slave trade; East Asia, specifically Taiwan and Japan; South America, notably Brazil; New Amsterdam; Jakarta and Indonesia.

With fresh eyes and surprising insights, it will take you beyond the fashionable fictions and clichés to look at the twenty-five years during which the United States, through six presidential administrations, was involved in Vietnamese affairs (1950-1975).

In the 20th and 21st century, how have people (including Africans, people of African descent, and marginalized populations without direct historical links to Africa) mobilized certain musics of the African Diaspora as practices of resistance to imperialism, apartheid, and segregation? Tracing intersecting and multi-directional movements of people, music, and culture across the oceanic divide between Africa, Europe and the Americas—the ""Atlantic Triangle""—we will examine the central role that music has played in the construction of social identities and movements, from the era of the transatlantic slave trade to the present day"

ASRC 6010,Psychoanalysis & Race,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"This graduate seminar will examine direct and indirect claims by W.E.B. DuBois, Franz Fanon, Sylvia Wynter, and Hortense Spillers for sociogeny as both a critique of and supplement to psychoanalytical theories and theorizations in Hegel, Freud, and Lacan. At its most basic, the seminar will interrogate how these African diaspora thinkers engage with psychoanalytical theories and practices. Because sociogeny posits an imperative for social analysis in the theorization of the psyche, we want to take a close look at how each of our thinkers presents his or her case for such an imperative. If sociogeny is an argument for racialization of the unconscious, then we also need to ask ourselves the following questions: What is racialization as a critical practice? Don't subjects already enter the world raced and gendered? Is it possible to racialize the mind and the unconscious? What relations are there between race, racialization, and pathology? Between race, racialization, and wellbeing? A component of the course will also be devoted to race and psychotherapy.

We will explore the post-colonial as a dynamic space that both plays off of and refigures the complicated dynamics of colonialism. The postcolonial challenges the dichotomies through which colonial power moved: western/indigenous, white/black, modern/traditional, global/local, developed/underdeveloped, and science/non-science. At the same time, it confronts the ways in which colonial histories are still embodied in institutions, identities, environments, and landscapes. Techno-scientific knowledge and practice have both enacted colonial divisions and been called on in post-colonial struggles. How them might we understand the work of scientific knowledge and practice in the kinds of hegemonies and struggles that shape our world today? We will explore this question by examining the way that technoscience is performed-by scientists, development workers, activists, government officials, and others. The class will pay particular attention to the located processes through which claims to the universal or global emerge.

And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the ""desert,"" both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the ""desert."" In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about ""wilderness"" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures"

We extend beyond Straussian ideological positions to include art unrestricted to written philosophy and literature, namely: painting, music, cinema, and Reason of State. Persecution (via censorship or heterodoxy) is understood as being both externally imposed and internalized. ""The double rhetoric"" or ""esotericism,"" hence ""writing between the lines,"" has its millennial history since archaic times. After discussing practices (from before Plato to Machiavelli, Spinoza, Bayle, Toland, Swift) we focus on recent techniques of ""concealing messages"" across disciplines, periods, places. Examples include Lessing (on Free Masons), Hegel (as read by Left-Hegelians and by Marx), Gramsci (Prison Notebooks); also Nietzsche, Heidegger, Freud, Wittgenstein, Carl Schmitt, Strauss, Dickinson, and their legacies.   "

In opposition to the poetic-heroic, one now has the prosaic-common giving form to life's expression. We will explore theoretical investigations of ""the prose of the world"" (e.g., Moretti, Lukacs, Auerbach), the rise of social statistics, and crucial novels and novellas of the 19th c by authors such as Keller, Stifter, and Fontane in the European context of Dickens, Balzac and Flaubert.   "

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If you answer these questions affirmatively, this course may be for you. We are told often that American primacy is in decline and that other powers are rising. What does this mean when we examine the experience of Government and Business in different countries around the world?  Is the international political economy a hydraulic system in which some units rise and others fall? Are the dynamics of the international political economy all pointing in one direction? Or are they marked by cross-currents?  This course seeks answers to these questions by teaching the basics of macro-economics, examining a range of powerful states (among others China, India, Russia and Japan) and persisting issues (financial globalization and foreign investment; oil and OPEC; trade and aid) as they play themselves out in different countries (such as Malaysia, Korea; Saudi Arabia, Nigeria; Mexico, Brazil, Uganda, Indonesia)"

In recent years the literature on the subject has grown and led to several calls to make gender issues central to policies for health in particular and development in general. While much of this literature is focused on the special disadvantages of women and girls, the course will include this focus but will also ask important questions related to the ignored distinction between sex and gender. When we think about the health impact of the social and economic disadvantages of women, we will look at the ways in which these female handicaps also translate into poor health outcomes for others, as well as put a brake on development in general"

One of the ways we do this is by incorporating adult learning approaches within the seminar's design and educational practice (andragogy, rather than pedagogy). Another way we apply what we study is by mentoring adult learners.  Each student serves as a learning partner to a Cornell employee who is pursuing an educational aim. A journey of mutual learning is a satisfying and meaningful adventure. As employees' partners, we are co-learners and co-educators, recognizing that each person has knowledge and experience to bring to the quest. "

From professional development to social change, town hall to union hall, or citizen science to workplace training, adult and community learning is everywhere. Yet, for many, the design and facilitation of meaningful learning experiences can be a s mysterious as an unopened black box. How does one go about creating inclusive educational experiences for diverse learners in our increasingly interconnected context?  In this course we open the box to become better leaders of learning and action.  A democatic and socially just society should enable all of its citizens to develop their potential to the full and to have the capacity, individually and collectively, to meet the challenge of change.  Through learning, people can come to make a real contribution to their own communities and participate in local and national democratic processes.  Two of the most ubiquitous formats of adult learning are 1) the workshop, and 2) one-on-one mentoring. As a backwards design approach and interactive facilitation principles can serve each application well, we will learn and practice both! In this course you will a) design and facilitate workshops, and b) mentor a Cornell employee as they pursues a learning goal, and do both by learning and applying design process and facilitation arts.  Meaningful. Practical. Fun"

ENGL 1605,West Campus Dialogue on Race,2,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"Like many elite universities in the United States, Cornell prides itself on the diversity of its student population. Yet many students remark how race influences the way Cornellians make friends, socialize, and affiliate on campus.

This class is aimed at all undergraduates for whom identity is an ongoing concern. This workshop-style course aims to develop practical approaches for integrating theoretical perspectives on identity and justice both in and out of the classroom.

The course draws on literature and film and gives students a solid foundation in the issues and vocabularies of the critical analysis of literature and culture. It is designed to be accessible and useful not only for English and literature majors (and prospective majors) but also for anyone interested in gaining a foundation in critical approaches to culture and society.

ENGL 2010,Literatures in English I: From Old English to the New World,3-4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Though it is now the global language of communication, English was once considered the vulgar tongue of a backwater. In this course, we will go to the sources of what we have come to call English literature to understand how texts and literary cultures played a role in shaping society and fashioning subjects, and how they also gave voice to dissent and difference — from the oral epic tradition of Beowulf to the public playhouses of Shakespeare's England, and from the intimate lyrics of the metaphysical poets to the indigenous and colonial voices of North America. We'll also take time to dwell on signal texts that can teach us the craft of literary invention. As we range from the boggiest depths of folk legend to the ""light fantastic"" of lyrical meter, we'll be building a toolkit of the literary terms and techniques that are necessary for the interpretation and creation of literary works. And through a series of exercises, students will gain hands-on experience with literary experimentation"

This course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction and films from Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about our selves, our world, and our future"
ENGL 2045,Major Poets,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Readings from the work of nine poets chosen to help us think about the nature and possibilities of poetry and different ways of engaging with it: Shakespeare (the sonnets), Alexander Pope, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, and A. R. Ammons. One assumption of the course is that there are other things to do with poems besides interpret them: reading aloud, writing imitations or parodies, memorizing, identifying poetic techniques, and creating anthologies of favorite poems. No previous study of poetry is presumed"
ENGL 2270,Shakespeare,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,PMA 2670,(LA-AS),(HB),,"This class aims to give students a good historical and critical grounding in Shakespeare's drama and its central place in Renaissance culture.

We will also pay attention to issues of identity, migration and the creation of the Caribbean diaspora. Constructions of tourist paradise and other stereotypes and the development of critical Caribbean institutions and national development will be discussed as we read and listen to some representative oral and written literature of the Caribbean and view some relevant film on the Caribbean. This inter-disciplinary survey provides students with a foundation for more specialized coursework on the Caribbean offered in our department"

We will read Pulitzer winning memoirs and NSFW gutter rubbish. We will trace the history of sequential art from about 1898 to the present, including caricature, pop art, and meme cultures, Wonder Woman and Wimmin's Comix, Archie and archives. Studying comics requires us to entangle disciplines and to make things: graphic design, marketing, media studies, law, education, and various illuminated cosmologies. What is this medium that teaches us to read the page anew, to speak in bubbles, to witness and play with apocalypse, to enjoy our suspension in the infinite, and to indulge in graphic sensations?"

Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records.

During the English civil war, Milton wrote radical prose pamphlets on regicide, divorce, censorship, and religion. He would later author one of the most widely celebrated epics in the Protestant English tradition. In this course, we will read Paradise Lost along with some of Milton's prose works and shorter poems to understand how he reconciled the dual imperatives to resist illegitimate rule and to obey true authority. Why was poetry was so crucial to Milton's ideas of proper governance? To answer that, we will examine the poetic and rhetorical figures that allowed him to distinguish paradox from contradiction, action from activity, and dissent from rebellion"
ENGL 3340,"Race, Class, Gender and Violence",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ASRC 3340,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Ideas change the world. Sometimes the same ideas can do tremendous good and also cause great suffering.

ENGL 3390,Jane Austen,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that students who have read Jane Austen must be in want of an opportunity to continue that delicious experience, and that those who have not read her novels should. This course explores Austen's characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems which resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen's importance in literary history as well as her continuing attraction in the twenty-first century.

This failure is due to the inability of national policy to imagine a world beyond a boundary drawn by the formative capitalist ideas of property, production, and profit. The course will begin by discussing the historical origin and continuing force of these ideas while raising questions about their limits. Then it will look at a range of alternative ideas about how the world should work if we want to keep it socially, economically, and ecologically in balance. The alternatives we will query come from a range of Indigenous writers of fiction, poetry, and theory, who locate themselves in Native American (north and south), Aboriginal, and Maori communities"

The testimonio usually tells a story in a collective mode, or offers an individual's story as representative of a people and, more specifically, a community. In this course, we consider both the literary, visual, and performative versions of testimonio in order to investigate how individual experiences can represent a group and resonate powerfully beyond geopolitical and cultural borders. We will also contemplate the end result or outcome of the testimonio. In other words, do testimonies change lives? Do they change laws? Do they help people heal and live?"
ENGL 3747,The Trouble with Crime Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Where would crime fiction be without its constitutive trouble—the corpse on the floor, the predatory femme fatale, the city steeped in corruption that only an honest sleuth can purge? And where would literary and filmic culture be without crime fiction to make trouble for—to parody, reinvent, complicate, and rejoice in? This course will review classic mystery story design in such writers as Poe, Doyle, Christie, and Chandler, and will read later fictions by such writers as Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas Pynchon, Patricia Highsmith, Michael Chabon, Sara Paretsky, China Miéville, and Mukoma Wa Ngugi, viewing films by Howard Hawks, Roman Polanski, and Paul Thomas Anderson—and promising never to let the trouble go away"

We will examine Asian American digital production, labor and performances within the broader contexts of imperialism, racism, migration, and the shifting parameters of Asian American studies. By situating ""new"" media productions and performances by Asian Americans within these contexts, this course attends to a few major questions: How does virtual Asianness engender modes of Asian Americanist critique? What are the relationships between Asian American digital media and neoliberalism/capitalism? Alternatively, how do these digital lives rupture or resist imperialist structures either in practice or theory? What futures and memories do online Asian American performances carve out?"

How is afropolitanism different from cosmopolitanism, diaspora, or pan-africanism? How about finding it out while exploring the theoretical, conceptual, fictional, cinematic, popular, and fashion manifestations of Afropolitanism. Coined in 2005 by fiction writer Taiye Silasi, Afropolitanism designates a new of mode of being African in the world. Afropolitans are this young and glamorous generation of African cosmopolitans (artists and intellectuals, such as Lupita Nyong'o, Teju Cole, Chimamanda Adichie, and Taye Silasi ) for whom the continent is no longer the repository of all that is wrong with humanity. This course will explore the history, politics, and ideologies of Afropolitanism and how the concept has been taken up in African fashion, theory, cinema, and literature.

Shakespeare transmits a classical cultural heritage to his early modern audience, he actively adapts it in thought-provoking and innovative ways. Shakespeare's major characters in these plays represent classical authority and yet are profoundly in conflict with it. While remaining attentive to complexities and indeterminacies in these texts, what responses—resistance, identification, affirmation, accommodation—are available to an author? What is the political charge of Roman (republican) plays in the context of English monarchy? What can we say about the cultural and sexual politics of Shakespeare's adaptive practices? What political, biopolitical, and cultural questions, past and present, do they raise?"

We will experiment theoretically and practically to create working desiring machines, taking as guides Deleuze and Guattari, ACT-UP, Critical Art Ensemble, subRosa, and Electronic Disturbance Theater. Students will combine cultural analysis and digital production to study how activists have used media to engage different audiences for different ends. The course mixes studio, lab, and seminar activities to explore theories and practices of tactical media through hands-on engagement with human-centered design, arguably the transmedia rhetoric of the global creative economy"

Shakespeare transmits a classical cultural heritage to his early modern audience, he actively adapts it in thought-provoking and innovative ways. Shakespeare's major characters in these plays represent classical authority and yet are profoundly in conflict with it. While remaining attentive to complexities and indeterminacies in these texts, what responses—resistance, identification, affirmation, accommodation—are available to an author? What is the political charge of Roman (republican) plays in the context of English monarchy? What can we say about the cultural and sexual politics of Shakespeare's adaptive practices? What political, biopolitical, and cultural questions, past and present, do they raise?"

FGSS 1111,FWS: Intersectionality: Feminst Ethnography Through New Media,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"This course uses 'intersectionality' as a lens for the study and production of media and ethnographic writing. We will read popular and academic texts on intersectionality—from its foundations in black feminism and beyond—that orient us towards the ways that race, class, gender, and other identities shape experiences of oppression and struggles for liberation. Applying an intersectional prism allows us to ask: how do Twitter hashtags such as #SayHerName and #BlackLivesMatter or music videos such as Beyoncé's 'Formation' invoke the dynamics of difference and sameness in today's social movements? Students will produce an original music video, a journalistic ethnographic essay, and a multimedia storytelling project, and gain insights on their own involvement in the structures of power inherent to research, media, and everyday life"

For example, divorce rates are falling at the same time that more American adults remain unmarried and more children are born to unmarried parents. What does any of this mean for the future of the institution? When advocacy groups used the term ""marriage equality"" to describe the legalization of same sex marriage at the federal level, why was marriage the institution through which diverse sexualities were made equal before the law? Through different styles of academic writing, students will address these and other pertinent questions about the meaning of marriage today"

It will concentrate on selected themes such as modernity, nationalism, and colonization in order to encourage students to challenge preconceived assumptions about Middle Eastern women, discuss some of the many roles they have played in social change, and think comparatively about gender, history, and social life. Students will be introduced to a wide array of literature produced in Western Europe and elsewhere pertaining to the Middle Eastern societies and cultures for a critical analysis of how knowledge and discourses about gender roles had been constructed in the course of the nineteenth century. In addition, students will learn about the ways in which Islamic law and legal institutions defined and managed the issues in relation to women's status as well as sexuality and marriage as social institutions. We will investigate how historical and contemporary political and social forces such as nationalism, colonialism, and revolutions operated in the course of the twentieth century, shaping both women's movement and advocating for women's rights before the law, access to education and family issues. Finally, this course will introduce students to the debates on ""gender as a useful category"" by connecting it to the recent and growing scholarship on masculinity and queer studies in the Middle East. By doing so, we will analyze relationality of women, men, and transgender categories and their political and social implications in the past and the present"

In the face of a largely male rabbinic elite, they have created new models of ritual, communal leadership, and textual interpretation both within and outside existing Jewish institutions and denominations. How have women mobilized embodied practice and knowledge in efforts to reinterpret, reclaim, and reinvent Judaism? How have these changes reverberated in communities that explicitly reject feminism? And what can these women teach us about religion, gender, and sexuality in America more broadly? This course will engage the fields of religion; gender, sexuality, and the body; textual and material culture; and feminism within the context of American Jewish life. The course will focus the contemporary United States, but will also explore layers of Jewish tradition from ancient to modern times and will consider women's practices in Israel as well. Key themes will include the relationships between gender and power; bodies, texts and objects; individual Jewish practices and communal identity; biology and theology; secularism and spirituality; and the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and conversion. Exploring how competing visions of Judaism reflect alternative understandings of gender and sexuality, we will probe the meaning of gender equality, how the Jewish experience compares to that of members of other faiths in America, and the challenge that these diverse Jewish projects pose to the American project of secularism"

We will approach theory as a tool for analyzing relations of power and a means of transforming ways of thinking and living. In particular, we will investigate the cultural, social, and historical assumptions that shape the possibilities and problematics of gender and sexuality. Throughout we will attend to specific histories of class, race, ethnicity, culture, nation, religion and sexuality, with an eye to their particular incitements to and challenges for feminist thinking and politics"
FGSS 3230,Gender and Global Change,3,Graded,Fall,,,DSOC 3230,(CA-AS),(GB),,"This course examines men's and women's lives and the impacts on them of incorporation into global economic and political systems. It asks how inequalities within and across gender categories are created in the process of social change, how gender intersects with class, race, and culture to shape the way change is experienced, and how institutions and social spaces become gendered. The course begins with the study of theoretical approaches or gender planning models to promote gender equality in policies and programs. We then turn to specific substantive areas of social life to consider how gender operates in different spaces, and we consider prospects for change beyond gender planning models in the form of social movements, politics, and the law"

This course is designed to offer a series of discussions about the following problems: (1) the historically specific modes of sexism and racism in social spaces related to Japan and other places in the trans-Pacific; (2) the mutual implication of sexism, racism, and social class in various contexts including those of colonialism, imperialism, and nationalism; (3) the roles of gender, race, and social class in the United States' knowledge production about East Asia in general; and (4) the conceptions of gender and race in the social formations particular to East Asia.

Films will be drawn from both mainstream and independent cinema and will include the work of directors such as Apichatpong Weerasethakul, Danny and Oxide Pang, Yau Ching, Thunska Pansittivorakul, Garin Nugroho, and Jean-Jacques Annaud"

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"

These categories that are based on ideas of personal responsibility and assumptions about race are modified somewhat by a liberal commitment to human rights.   Our purpose in this course is to understand how such ideas have taken root and to locate the consequences of these ideas for policy and practice. "

We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement"

We are told often that American primacy is in decline and that other powers are rising. What does this mean when we examine the experience of Government and Business in different countries around the world?  Is the international political economy a hydraulic system in which some units rise and others fall? Are the dynamics of the international political economy all pointing in one direction? Or are they marked by cross-currents?  This course seeks answers to these questions by teaching the basics of macro-economics, examining a range of powerful states (among others China, India, Russia and Japan) and persisting issues (financial globalization and foreign investment; oil and OPEC; trade and aid) as they play themselves out in different countries (such as Malaysia, Korea; Saudi Arabia, Nigeria; Mexico, Brazil, Uganda, Indonesia)"

After an initial presentation of the classical Marxist texts on ideology, we will examine twentieth century reworkings of hegemony theorist Antonio Gramsci and the critical structuralist approaches of Roland Barthes, Jean Baudrillard and Dick Hebdige. We will concentrate on the ""lived relation"" to ruling ideas in the form of ideologies of everyday life. The second part of the course will be devoted to psychoanalytically oriented theories (Freud, Lacan) which address the internalization of belief, both in relation to the intrapsychic and in the interaction between psychic and state apparatuses. We conclude with Louis Althusser's notion of interpellation, which resumes the Marxist, structuralist and psychoanalytic objectives of the course material. The theorists in the second part of the course will be contextualized within the experience of the historical traumas of fascism and French decolonization. Throughout the semester, we will be reflecting on the continued relevance of historic ideologies, centered around notions of class interest, to late twentieth century ideologies' attachments to national, religious, gendered, ethnic, technological identity"

Do the militaries of democracies fight better in the field than those of non-democracies? Does the death penalty save lives by deterring murders? Answering questions like these about the effects of public policy implies cause and effect knowledge: if we implement policy X, we will get effect Y. But on what evidence should answers to questions like these rest? How do you know the answer, and under what conditions can you? Providing robust answers to cause-and-effect questions in a (mostly) non-experimental field like political science is devilishly difficult. In this course, we will learn some of the pitfalls that make it so hard to evaluate evidence in the public policy realm, how to judge the quality of evidence cited in the media, and how to ask the right questions to get the best possible evidence. We'll do so by working through the evidence supporting ""yes"" or ""no"" answers to the questions listed above"

These are essential for interpreting typical models of categories and counts, since in the typical application, effects on the mean of the dependent variable are not constant but vary with settings of the explanatory variables. We then proceed to the key application, the analysis of non-continuous dependent variables. Each student will be required to actively participate in a group presentation of the nuts and bolts of a data analysis using this kind of data, either assigned by the instructor or based off peer research.

What other geographic units of analysis might we consider in thinking about what Iberian explorers and intellectuals initially called the 'fourth part' of the world?  Given the scope and extent of the Spanish and Portuguese empires, could 'the Americas' extend from the Caribbean to the Philippines?  This course takes up such questions as a means to explore the history of what would become-only in the nineteenth century-'Latin America.' We move from the initial ""encounters"" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the ""New World,"" the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century.

A political philosophy and approach to social organization that arose simultaneous with other grand ""-isms,"" anarchism, perhaps more than any other idea and practice, has been condensed down by its critics and observers into a vague set of often contradictory caricatures. Is 'it' characterized by bohemian communities of nihilists, their rebellion culturally innovative but politically impotent, book-ended by Friedrich Nietzsche and Johnny Rotten; or is 'it' individualist libertarians who walk in the ideological footsteps of Ayn Rand and Milton Friedman rather than Mikhail Bakunin and Peter Kropotkin; or, most famously, is 'it' a murky underworld of conspiratorial bomb throwers, held together less by bonds of solidarity than by a commitment to violence? This course provides some relief from such limited and constraining perspectives by taking anarchism seriously as a lived tradition of direct, non-hierarchical democracy"

For the next millennium, Islam glittered. Its caliphs, courts, and capitals were grander, more powerful, and more sophisticated than those of any medieval king, duke or prince. In this course, we will trace the emergence and development of Islamic civilization from the birth of Muhammad ca. 570 to the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. We will read the Qur'an and listen to its recitation; examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad; follow the course of the Arab conquests; explore the nature of the conflict between Sunnis and Shi'is; learn about the five pillars of Islam, sharia law, theology, and Sufism; and assess the achievements of Muslim intellectuals in literature, art, architecture, science, and philosophy.

Today, leaders and members of such groups –now known as Islamists –insist that one cannot live a fully Islamic life in the absence of an Islamic state. How and why did these movements come to focus on building an Islamic state? When did Islam come to be seen as indivisible from Politics, and what does it mean for Islam and Politics to be related? Are contemporary claims to Islam as the basis for political action consistent with the ways in which Muslims have understood their core texts historically? This course will introduce students to the study of Religion and Politics in Islamic History, beginning with the early Islamic community under the rule of the Prophet Muhammad, stretching through a period of rule that saw multiple Islamic Caliphates, and finally, reaching the present day. The bulk of this course, however, will focus on the diverse ways in which Muslims in the twentieth and twenty first centuries have laid claim to their religion as a template for political and social action. In particular, it will push students to consider how Muslim men and women live religion in their daily lives, whether through dress, prayer, or facial hair, and how these claims to religion shape political systems from the ground up"

Films and fiction are saturated with images of zombies, environmental catastrophe, or nuclear disaster. Why are we so fascinated with the end of the world, and what is the genealogy of this imagery? What can visions of Armageddon tell us about past societal hopes and anxieties? How were they used to make claims about human nature and about who did and did not deserve salvation? This course traces apocalyptic thought from the Protestant reformation onwards, with a particular emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe.

HIST 2664,What's Colonial About Early America?,4,Graded,Fall,,,AMST 2664,(HA-AS),(HB),,"Many Americans envision the colonial period as a relatively quaint and benign time dominated by Pocahontas, the Pilgrims, and provinciality.  Pairing the term ""colonial"" with ""America"" also tends to render the nearly-three centuries between Europeans' arrival in the western hemisphere and the Declaration of Independence as the prehistory of the United States when in fact multiple colonial regimes existed in North America at any time prior to 1776.  This course investigates the rich, complex, and violent history of early America with the objective of a fresh appreciation of its ""colonial"" aspects – natural resource extraction, territorial expropriation and displacement of indigenous peoples, exploitation of enslaved labor, and the imposition of juridical authority over ""settled"" spaces – with an eye toward a better understanding of the larger patterns of domination (however incomplete) in which the emergent international state system and global capitalism creating imbalances of wealth and power that persist to this day.  In addition to exploration of familiar sites like the thirteen Anglo-American colonies, the course will venture into less well-known areas (including those outside contemporary national American boundaries) to enhance students' appreciation of the diversity of human in experience in early America via comparative analysis"

It will cover 1) the history of terrorism as it developed over the course of the modern era (in the process distinguishing terrorism from other forms of modern political violence, e.g. partisan warfare, state terror, etc.) and 2) the ways terrorism has been perceived, presented, and remembered by contemporaries and subsequent generations. Questions, therefore, will include the following: How has terrorism been approached by political theory, history, literature, etc.? How have these approaches constructed terrorism as an object of scientific investigation? How were terrorists perceived and represented by their contemporaries (in the press, literature, the arts)? How did terrorists represent themselves (in political pamphlets, autobiographies, fiction)?

As well as this temporal survey, we will consider a number of ongoing themes: race, bodily difference, and medicine; medicine and the environment; women, gender, and medicine; the history of the body; the history of sexuality; and the close connections between forms of social order and forms of medical knowledge.

HIST 2726,Culture and Identity in Modern America: The 19th Century,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 2726,(HA-AS),(HB),,"The nineteenth century changed everything in the United States: it gave us what we think of as modern American culture.  The nation went from rural, agrarian, economically dependent, partially enslaved, and otherwise relatively homogeneous, to urban, industrial, economically powerful, emancipated, and relatively heterogeneous.  Americans embraced corporate capitalism and consumerism at the end of the century, and that, in particular, has had a lasting impact. This course examines all those changes, with an emphasis on the development of cultural and intellectual diversity in the United States. Key topics and themes include: literature; slavery, abolition, and racial issues; the women's movement; Darwinism and Social Darwinism; professionalization; individualism; landscape and environment; class and capitalism; responses to industrialization and modernization; expansion and the western frontier; and visual culture. We'll focus on both ideas and individuals, using mostly primary documents but contextualizing and cross-examining them as we go. Perhaps the overarching theme is the contestation of culture: we'll explore the ways in which individuals both shape and are shaped by their society—the ways in which they both reinforce and resist its pressures. Of course, there is no one definitive characteristic of our cultural heritage, but in this course we will make a concerted effort to consider what people mean when they say ""America.""  We'll try especially hard to see how certain 19th-century definitions of American culture have carried through to the 21st century"

This course endeavors to separate fact from fantasy while introducing the social, cultural, and political history of Inner Asia in the medieval and early modern periods. We will explore the impact of cross-cultural contacts on the region's diverse societies as we witness the rise and fall of empires, both nomadic and sedentary. We will focus especially on the histories of Muslim communities, as Islam has been the predominant religious tradition in the region for the last millennium. Special emphasis will be given to reading texts produced by Inner Asian authors, as we endeavor to consider the region's history not only from the vantage point of foreign observers and conquerors, but also from within"

HIST 3312,What was the Vietnam War?,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,ASIAN 3312,,,,"If you have ever wondered what the Vietnam War was all about, how did it begin, how was it fought, why was it so controversial, why did the American people turn against it, why was it important, why were generations of American students taught the North Vietnamese version of the war, why the South Vietnamese allies of the United States were abandoned, and what happened to the Vietnamese and the Americans as a result of the war—then this class is for you! With fresh eyes and surprising insights, it will take you beyond the fashionable fictions and clichés to look at the twenty-five years during which the United States, through six presidential administrations, was involved in Vietnamese affairs (1950-1975). For decades, Americans have been meditating on ""the lessons of the Vietnam War,"" but it turns out that neither was any lesson ever learned nor were the so-called ""lessons"" even plausibly related to actual events. Today, Americans continue to be taught myths about the Vietnam War. This course shows why these myths obstruct a realistic understanding of American history during the past half-century"

Does China's recent heavy investment in Africa portend a movement away from or a continuation of Africa's economic underdevelopment? These questions and others will be addressed in this course. "

We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights"

ILROB 3730,"Culture, Leadership, and Change: Engaging Students in Campus Life and Beyond",4,GradeNoAud,Fall or spring,,,,,,,"What does it mean to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including ""binge drinking,"" ""sexual violence,"" and ""hazing."" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior. This course will teach students;"

ILROB 4245,Managing and Leading Social Innovation,4,GradeNoAud,Fall,,,,,,,"As the challenges of poverty, income inequality, environmental degradation, and global health continue to mount, there is a growing need for innovative approaches to seemingly intractable social problems.

Corporations engage in corporate social responsibility and social intrapreneurship, while traditional non-profits incorporate business practices in an effort to more efficiently and effectively pursue their social missions. In between, there are growing numbers of hybrid social enterprises whose core purpose is to address social issues through commercial ventures. This course explores these varied for-profit, non-profit, and hybrid models for managing and leading social innovation. We will examine the unique challenges and opportunities of each approach and the leadership skills needed to effectively address them. Through readings, class discussion, guest speakers, interactive exercises, and a final project with a community partner, students will master theoretical frameworks and gain practical knowledge and experience that will equip them to manage and lead social innovation in new and existing organizations across a variety of contexts"

JPLIT 6618,Modern Japanese Philosophy II,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,reading knowledge of Japanese,,,,,,"In this course we will investigate the concepts of race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture in modern Japanese philosophy and social and human sciences. In recent years, an increasing number of the students of Asian studies have engaged in new developments in the humanities that consider the close relationships between the production of desires in popular cultures and political aspects of social formations. Yet, what has been overlooked is the elementary need to investigate the emotive and fantastic elements in identity politics for the critical comprehension of the national community. We will investigate how the concept of culture serves in ethnic nationalism and racism, minority positions in the politics of multiethnic nationalism, and how racism is coterminous with nationalism? In order to meet this demand, this course is designed to offer students the opportunity to read, analyze, and evaluate the philosophical and social and human scientific discourse of modern East Asia in conjunction with European and American texts. This seminar will be organized neither as a search for the national (or oriental) character of Japanese philosophy nor as a project of explaining philosophical arguments in terms of the traits of national culture, but rather as an attempt to comprehend how philosophy participates in the construction and transformation of given social formations"

In the face of a largely male rabbinic elite, they have created new models of ritual, communal leadership, and textual interpretation both within and outside existing Jewish institutions and denominations. How have women mobilized embodied practice and knowledge in efforts to reinterpret, reclaim, and reinvent Judaism? How have these changes reverberated in communities that explicitly reject feminism? And what can these women teach us about religion, gender, and sexuality in America more broadly? This course will engage the fields of religion; gender, sexuality, and the body; textual and material culture; and feminism within the context of American Jewish life. The course will focus the contemporary United States, but will also explore layers of Jewish tradition from ancient to modern times and will consider women's practices in Israel as well. Key themes will include the relationships between gender and power; bodies, texts and objects; individual Jewish practices and communal identity; biology and theology; secularism and spirituality; and the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and conversion. Exploring how competing visions of Judaism reflect alternative understandings of gender and sexuality, we will probe the meaning of gender equality, how the Jewish experience compares to that of members of other faiths in America, and the challenge that these diverse Jewish projects pose to the American project of secularism"

The course examines the production and performance of Latina/o identity. We begin by asking the following? How is Latina/o identity defined?  How is latinidad performed?  We then focus on the politics of ethnic labels and segue into both the Chicana/o and Nuyorican movements as initial sites of Latina/o resistance. We continue by analyzing the immigration of other Latina/o groups such as Cubans and Dominicans, alongside Central and South Americans into the United States, by attending to current issues such as immigration policies and reform. In situating the class around ""Latina/o"" as both an umbrella term and an enacted social construction, we are then able to turn our attention to representations of latinidad within different genres of cultural expressions, such as music and literature alongside critical theory"

Since immigration shows no signs of slowing down—in the United States or in many other nations of the world—the causes, consequences and repercussions of immigration will be one of the most important topics of the 21- century. Therefore this class will examine the history and contemporary role of immigration in the U.S. political system. The class will focus on two aspects of immigration: First, a historical examination of immigration policy from the founding of the country all the way forward to the current debate over immigration reform. Second, we will evaluate and assess the political incorporation and political participation of immigrant groups in the U.S. and determine whether immigrants are being incorporated, and if not, why?

We begin by reviewing the legal foundations of immigrant labor, including the current immigration enforcement regime, and the role of legal status in labor standards enforcement protections.  We examine how organized labor has evolved with regards to immigrant workers, shifting from supporting employer sanctions in 1986, to repudiating them as a tool for employer control in 2001.  We then evaluate the role that immigrant workers have played in the revitalization of the labor movement, and the challenges that remain for unions.  Beyond unions, we examine the emergence of new forms of worker representation, including the varying types of worker centers.  We focus on the proliferation of day labor centers, and more recently, non-union efforts to organize workers in the restaurant industry.  We even consider the role of undocumented workers in the public sector, made possible through the increased use of subcontracting. We look at how public entities have turned to worker organizations to help hold employers accountable, and how workers have turned to local governments to strengthen worker protections (such as higher minimum wages and strengthened penalties for wage theft), as well as how states have become new targets for policy change  (such as recent victories for domestic workers).  We also discuss binational efforts to advance immigrant worker rights.  We end by considering prospects for federal immigration reform, and the implications these proposals may have for immigrant worker rights"

The testimonio usually tells a story in a collective mode, or offers an individual's story as representative of a people and, more specifically, a community. In this course, we consider both the literary, visual, and performative versions of testimonio in order to investigate how individual experiences can represent a group and resonate powerfully beyond geopolitical and cultural borders.

And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the ""desert,"" both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the ""desert."" In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria.

Why did these practices develop into traditions as seemingly disparate as Cuban Santería's sacred batá drumming and the secular blues music of the American South? In the 20th and 21st century, how have people (including Africans, people of African descent, and marginalized populations without direct historical links to Africa) mobilized certain musics of the African Diaspora as practices of resistance to imperialism, apartheid, and segregation? Tracing intersecting and multi-directional movements of people, music, and culture across the oceanic divide between Africa, Europe and the Americas—the ""Atlantic Triangle""—we will examine the central role that music has played in the construction of social identities and movements, from the era of the transatlantic slave trade to the present day"

This course will explore different ways of approaching media by focusing on the aspect of ""sound"" and its representations. Using a wide variety of case studies including the short stories of Kafka, the BBC radio series The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, The Lord of the Rings Online game, and the Studio Ghibli films, we will investigate the production, (re)presentation, translation, and perception of sounds in the twentieth- and twenty-first century media.

In this course, we will study the interaction of causality and machine learning for the purpose of (mostly) designing intelligent systems that make decisions. In the case of known causal effects, we will briefly review the theory of generalization as it applies to designing action policies and systems.

For all its grand nicknames and associations, Inner Asia remains a region little-studied in the West. This course endeavors to separate fact from fantasy while introducing the social, cultural, and political history of Inner Asia in the medieval and early modern periods. We will explore the impact of cross-cultural contacts on the region's diverse societies as we witness the rise and fall of empires, both nomadic and sedentary. We will focus especially on the histories of Muslim communities, as Islam has been the predominant religious tradition in the region for the last millennium. Special emphasis will be given to reading texts produced by Inner Asian authors, as we endeavor to consider the region's history not only from the vantage point of foreign observers and conquerors, but also from within"

In the face of a largely male rabbinic elite, they have created new models of ritual, communal leadership, and textual interpretation both within and outside existing Jewish institutions and denominations. How have women mobilized embodied practice and knowledge in efforts to reinterpret, reclaim, and reinvent Judaism? How have these changes reverberated in communities that explicitly reject feminism? And what can these women teach us about religion, gender, and sexuality in America more broadly? This course will engage the fields of religion; gender, sexuality, and the body; textual and material culture; and feminism within the context of American Jewish life. The course will focus the contemporary United States, but will also explore layers of Jewish tradition from ancient to modern times and will consider women's practices in Israel as well. Key themes will include the relationships between gender and power; bodies, texts and objects; individual Jewish practices and communal identity; biology and theology; secularism and spirituality; and the intersectionality of race, gender, sexuality, and conversion. Exploring how competing visions of Judaism reflect alternative understandings of gender and sexuality, we will probe the meaning of gender equality, how the Jewish experience compares to that of members of other faiths in America, and the challenge that these diverse Jewish projects pose to the American project of secularism"

Today, leaders and members of such groups –now known as Islamists –insist that one cannot live a fully Islamic life in the absence of an Islamic state. How and why did these movements come to focus on building an Islamic state? When did Islam come to be seen as indivisible from Politics, and what does it mean for Islam and Politics to be related? Are contemporary claims to Islam as the basis for political action consistent with the ways in which Muslims have understood their core texts historically? This course will introduce students to the study of Religion and Politics in Islamic History, beginning with the early Islamic community under the rule of the Prophet Muhammad, stretching through a period of rule that saw multiple Islamic Caliphates, and finally, reaching the present day. The bulk of this course, however, will focus on the diverse ways in which Muslims in the twentieth and twenty first centuries have laid claim to their religion as a template for political and social action. In particular, it will push students to consider how Muslim men and women live religion in their daily lives, whether through dress, prayer, or facial hair, and how these claims to religion shape political systems from the ground up"

What difference would (or could) the existence of God make to our lives? Religion & Reason examines the idea, shared by several major world religions, that God must be an absolutely perfect being. What attributes must a perfect being have: must it have a mind, be a person, care for human beings? Is the concept of a perfect being coherent? Is the existence of a perfect being compatible with the presence of evil in the world, the existence of human freedom, the nature of the world as modern science understands it? Does what is morally right and wrong depend in any important way on the nature or will of a perfect being? Is a perfect being among the things that actually inhabit our universe? The course approaches these questions with the tools and methods of philosophical reason and through readings drawn from both classic texts and contemporary philosophical discussion"

Films and fiction are saturated with images of zombies, environmental catastrophe, or nuclear disaster. Why are we so fascinated with the end of the world, and what is the genealogy of this imagery? What can visions of Armageddon tell us about past societal hopes and anxieties? How were they used to make claims about human nature and about who did and did not deserve salvation? This course traces apocalyptic thought from the Protestant reformation onwards, with a particular emphasis on Central and Eastern Europe. Case studies range from radical millenarian sects to Chernobyl, and readings include all from Dostoevsky to Czech New Wave cinema. "

This course examines the constant and dynamic tension between that which unites Jews in all these different times and places, and that which makes every Jew a person of his or her own time and place. Our whirlwind tour will take us from ancient Israel, through Babylonia and the world of early Islam, into the medieval origins of Ashkenazi Jewry, down to Ottoman North Africa, and all the way across the Indian Ocean.

For the next millennium, Islam glittered. Its caliphs, courts, and capitals were grander, more powerful, and more sophisticated than those of any medieval king, duke or prince. In this course, we will trace the emergence and development of Islamic civilization from the birth of Muhammad ca. 570 to the Mongol sack of Baghdad in 1258. We will read the Qur'an and listen to its recitation; examine the career of the Prophet Muhammad; follow the course of the Arab conquests; explore the nature of the conflict between Sunnis and Shi'is; learn about the five pillars of Islam, sharia law, theology, and Sufism; and assess the achievements of Muslim intellectuals in literature, art, architecture, science, and philosophy.

Many courses cover aspects of ancient political history or ancient literature, but these often focus on the activities of members of social elites (who produced most of the writing), at the expense of the activities of more average citizens. The focus of this class is on ancient technologies, human interactions with the environment and how these play into the creation and maintenance of social systems. It will provide a broad spectrum, spanning all social classes, and many different kinds of resources and activities.

We'll be trying various kinds of exercises - from reading poems and looking at paintings to eating more slowly - as we read about the ways in which our seneses reach out to the world, and as we think together about how technology may be used in ways that are not, strictly speaking, technological. This course is for students at all levels, from all backgrounds, graduate and undergraduate, with the understanding that we all need an excuse to slow down and observe the world - and ourselves - a little more carefully"

An important source for his life is the Sira of Ibn Ishaq (d. ca. 761), a biography that opens with Muhammad's birth ca. 570 and ends with his death in 632. If we take the narrative reports in this text at face-value, then Muhammad appears to have been born in the full light of history. But is the Sira a reliable source for the historical Muhammad?

And how do sensory landscapes, more specifically-territories of sight, sound, touch, taste, and smell-inform, inflect, and engage the religious imagination? When and why do religious practices, rituals, traditions, and beliefs inhabit particular landscapes? This seminar treats these questions by focusing on a particular landscape-the ""desert,"" both imagined and real-as it has shaped religious ascetic practice. Biblical notions of howling desert wastelands and subsequent ideas about deserts inhabited by terrifying and grotesque demons; paradise, a garden where angels' wings whir and pure light shines; valleys of rattling dry bones, sinews, and skins that breathe with new life; heavens clanging with the sound of war between seven-headed dragons and angels; demons coming in the forms of roaring lions and hissing serpents-the religious imaginary is shaped in striking ways by sensory landscapes. We will read widely from desert Christian monastic literatures, mostly from late ancient Egypt, to explore both the historical development of monasticism in Christianity and examine why the monastic impulse seems so closely tied to the ""desert."" In addition to reading saints lives, we will read early monastic rules, the desert fathers, and we will draw from archaeological sources to examine the varieties of ascetic practices in the deserts of late ancient Egypt, Gaza, Sinai, Palestine, and Syria. Throughout the course we will explore ancient and modern ideas about ""wilderness"" and we will explore parallels between ancient Near Eastern literatures and their nineteenth- and twentieth-century parallels in the American frontier and environmental literatures"

No. We have ample evidence that what people consider as their senses varies widely across societies, cultures, and national borders. Sensory experiencing also changes over time, with new technologies. This seminar engages the global diversity of sensory apprehension, honing in on multiple sensory forms of 'pollution' (aesthetic, political, ecological, religious, legal and cultural), and emerging conceptual and experiential approaches to ""polluted senses."" Concepts and enactments of pollution affect what is communally sacred, social, and environmental, but also what is degenerative, contaminated, or corrupt such as health or moral crises and social, political conflicts"

STS 4240,Designing Technology for Social Impact,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,INFO 4240,(CA-AS),,,"The social impact of technologies is typically thought about fairly late, if ever, in the design process. Indeed, it can be difficult at design time to predict what effects technologies will have. Nevertheless, design decisions can inadvertently ""lock in"" particular values early on. In this course, we will draw on science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be ""built into"" a technology?

We will explore the post-colonial as a dynamic space that both plays off of and refigures the complicated dynamics of colonialism. The postcolonial challenges the dichotomies through which colonial power moved: western/indigenous, white/black, modern/traditional, global/local, developed/underdeveloped, and science/non-science. At the same time, it confronts the ways in which colonial histories are still embodied in institutions, identities, environments, and landscapes. Techno-scientific knowledge and practice have both enacted colonial divisions and been called on in post-colonial struggles. How them might we understand the work of scientific knowledge and practice in the kinds of hegemonies and struggles that shape our world today? We will explore this question by examining the way that technoscience is performed-by scientists, development workers, activists, government officials, and others. The class will pay particular attention to the located processes through which claims to the universal or global emerge. In addition by considering controversies over the environment, medicine, and indigenous knowledge, we will consider the effects of such claims"
