But the law is only part of our focus. Rights do not spring into existence simply because a judge pounded a gavel or a president signed a bill. The rights and liberties we take for granted have been the subject of violent and bitter contests that go to the very meaning of national identity. To study the law of civil rights and civil liberties in this country is to study not just a collection of cases and statutes, but a history of endless struggle and eternally unfulfilled promise about what it means to be an American. Like GOVT 3001, this class places the development of civil rights and civil liberties in historic, political, and economic context"

This course borrows from hip hop's notion of ""representing"" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, film, and online. How is Brooklyn represented? Who represents Brooklyn? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality, and identity formation more broadly speaking? While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. Now a ""global brand,"" New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. The course examines Black cultural production as it relates to representations of Brooklyn. It also deconstructs images and discourses that marginalize the borough's Black residents. Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of films including Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's diverse communities.

This course begins in the late nineteenth century, defining it as a pivotal moment in U.S. immigration and labor history when efforts to regulate immigrant entry and naturalization became increasingly bureaucratized. As part of the course we will examine the causes and consequences of working-class migration to the United States from a comparative historical, ethno-racial, class-based, and gendered perspective. We will also address questions regarding the perceived benefit and cost of immigration at both the national and local (i.e., community) levels. In this sense, we will explore the economic, social, cultural, and political impact immigrants have had on the United States over time. Finally, we will consider how immigrants have negotiated the pressures of their new surroundings, and challenged dominant conceptions of American national identity and citizenship in the process"

We will read, think, talk and write about the incarceration experience and about policies that shape this experience. We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement"

They have a profound influence on American society, especially on our political community.  They amplify inequality and disadvantage. The massive number of people imprisoned in the United States speaks volumes about our policy priorities and about our democracy. How did things get this way? How did we end up being the nation that incarcerates more of its population than virtually any other? What policy processes directly and indirectly account for this? What explains the change that we now appear to be experiencing? What is the future of the U.S. prison system? What is the future of our democracy?

More specifically, how does a politics of vulnerability help us address the worldwide refugee crisis? How does it limit or preclude an understanding of certain conditions? How might the notion of precarity / precarious lives supplement vulnerability? We will use the growing body of feminist scholarship on vulnerability in law, philosophy, migration studies, and other fields to analyze the refugee crisis in particular locations, including Central American refugees being detained in the U.S. and Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe.

""Asians"" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the ""Asians?"" On what basis can we label ""Asians"" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category ""Asian"" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States.

But heritage is also the foundation for a multi-billion dollar tourist industry and a basis for claims to national sovereignty. A closer look at heritage reveals institutions, places, and things possessed of extraordinary power. Drawing on case studies from around the world, this course attends to the complexities of heritage today. Topics include heritage ethics, tourism and the marketing of the past, approaches to preservation and management, disputed heritage and violence, heritage ideologies from nationalism to universalism, participation and inequality from the grassroots to the global, ""counterheritage"", and the practice of public archaeology.

This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world.

The course begins with a short survey of the major religious traditions of South Asia: Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, Sikhism, and Islam. We look to the development of these traditions through historical and cultural perspectives. The course then turns to the modern period, considering the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization upon religious ideologies and practices. The primary focus of the course will be the ethnographic study of contemporary religious practices in the region. We examine phenomena such as ritual, pilgrimage, possession, devotionalism, monasticism, asceticism, and revivalism through a series of ethnographic case studies. In so doing, we also seek to understand the impact of politics, modernity, diasporic movement, social inequality, changing gender roles, and mass mediation upon these traditions and practices"

This course borrows from hip hop's notion of ""representing"" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, film, and online. How is Brooklyn represented? Who represents Brooklyn? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality, and identity formation more broadly speaking? While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. Now a ""global brand,"" New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. The course examines Black cultural production as it relates to representations of Brooklyn. It also deconstructs images and discourses that marginalize the borough's Black residents. Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of films including Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's diverse communities. While materials are interdisciplinary in approach, our investigation is informed by anthropological, historical, and literary texts covering topics including immigration, youth culture, transnationalism, gentrification, authenticity, and classed, gendered and racialized inequality"

Like forensic scientists at the scene of the crime, bioarchaeologists search for clues embedded in human bone and mummified tissues to reconstruct how ancient peoples lived and died. As a dynamic living system, the human skeleton responds not only to hormones that govern human development but also to physiological stress brought on by disease, malnutrition, and trauma. The human body is also an artifact molded by cultural understandings of gender, prestige, self-expression, and violence. In this course, students will learn the scientific techniques for estimating skeletal age and sex, diagnosing pathology, and reconstructing diet and migration patterns.

By the end of the semester, students will be able to articulate some ways that Hasidism reflects both broader trends in European religious and moral thought of its time, and some ways that it represents distinctively Jewish developments. You will also gain a deeper appreciation of the various kinds of evidence and disciplinary approaches that need to be brought to bear on the attempt to articulate as broad, deep and varied a phenomenon as modern Hasidic Judaism. "
ANTHR 3476,Philosophy and Anthropology Together,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ANTHR 6476,(SBA-AS),(HB),,"Philosophy remains anthropology's closest sister-discipline, or even its mother-discipline. Anthropology and philosophy are both dedicated to self-understanding: seeking to figure out what it is to be human, and what this means for us, raising questions such as how we can know the world, and ourselves, and how we should live;  the relationship between language, culture and the world; how we differ from other animals; and much more. Both disciplines have tried to generalize about humanity, but because of its acute awareness of cultural diversity, the younger field of anthropology diverged from philosophy. In this course we re-build a ""philosophically aware anthropology,"" and take philosophy to task, by way of inspired readings carried out in a sympathetic yet critical spirit: We discuss a selection of important philosophers' and anthropologists' writings, and interdisciplinary dialogues"

""Asians"" overseas, in particular, have won repute as a people who cling tenaciously to their culture and refuse to assimilate into their host societies and cultures. But, who are the ""Asians?"" On what basis can we label ""Asians"" an ethnic group? Although there is a significant Asian presence in the Caribbean, the category ""Asian"" itself does not exist in the Caribbean. What does this say about the nature of categories that label and demarcate groups of people on the basis of alleged cultural and phenotypical characteristics? This course will examine the dynamics behind group identity, namely ethnicity, by comparing and contrasting the multicultural experience of Asian populations in the Caribbean and the United States.

This course looks not only at animals in their social lives, but also at animals in their lives with us. We ask questions about how species become entangled and what that means for both parties, about the social lives of animals independently and with humans, about the survival of human and animal species, and about what it means to use animals for science, food, and profit.

An object rarely has a single meaning; they are read variously in different cultural settings, and even by different individuals within a cultural system. How does one know -- can one know -- the meanings of an object? How are objects strategically deployed in social interaction (particularly in cross-cultural interactions, where each side may have radically different understandings)? How does one even know what an object is? We will explore the history and variety of ways that material culture and its meanings have been studied, using archaeological and ethnographic examples"

ANTHR 4732,The New Latin American State,4,Graded,Spring,,,LATA 4732,(CA-AS),(GB),,"Latin America today is the site of multiple utopian and practical experiments in governance. This seminar will problematize the simultaneous growth of neo-liberal, neo-socialist, and para-state formations. Using ethnography, documentary film, and theories of Latin American geopolitics, we will explore how dominant paradigms for political economy and fantasies of control emerge within contests over charisma, power, and legitimate violence. Why have indigenous and ethno-racialized social movements, or the return of the traditionally repressed, figured in projects of national or counter-national revitalization? What roles have self-defense organizations played in the re-definition of civil society? What does it mean to advocate for 'cultural diversity' or 'rights of nature'? Why have discourses of 'security' and 'human rights' come to be so charged in state bureaucracies and horizontalist political associations alike? This seminar will delve into a wide ranging array of texts that probe these and other questions about the new Latin American state"

The nature of these linkages is debated from strongly contesting points of view in social theory (structuralist, poststructuralist, utilitarian, hermeneutic, Marxist). Unlike debates in critical theory where the form of contestation has been mainly philosophical, in anthropology these issues have developed in ethnographic analyses. The course briefly surveys kinship theory and economic anthropology with a focus on implications for general issues in social theory. Discussion of attempts to develop dialectical syntheses around the motion of ""practice"" follows. The issues addressed in this section carry over into the next, colonialism and post-colonialism, in which poststructuralist readings of history are counterposed to Marxist ones. Finally, Lacanian and Marxist visions of ideology as they relate to anthropological theory and ethnographic analysis are examined with particular emphasis on the cultural and social production of persons"

Like forensic scientists at the scene of the crime, bioarchaeologists search for clues embedded in human bone and mummified tissues to reconstruct how ancient peoples lived and died. As a dynamic living system, the human skeleton responds not only to hormones that govern human development but also to physiological stress brought on by disease, malnutrition, and trauma. The human body is also an artifact molded by cultural understandings of gender, prestige, self-expression, and violence. In this course, students will learn the scientific techniques for estimating skeletal age and sex, diagnosing pathology, and reconstructing diet and migration patterns.

By the end of the semester, students will be able to articulate some ways that Hasidism reflects both broader trends in European religious and moral thought of its time, and some ways that it represents distinctively Jewish developments. You will also gain a deeper appreciation of the various kinds of evidence and disciplinary approaches that need to be brought to bear on the attempt to articulate as broad, deep and varied a phenomenon as modern Hasidic Judaism. "

ANTHR 6476,Philosophy and Anthropology Together,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ANTHR 3476,,,,"Philosophy remains anthropology's closest sister-discipline, or even its mother-discipline. Anthropology and philosophy are both dedicated to self-understanding: seeking to figure out what it is to be human, and what this means for us, raising questions such as how we can know the world, and ourselves, and how we should live;  the relationship between language, culture and the world; how we differ from other animals; and much more. Both disciplines have tried to generalize about humanity, but because of its acute awareness of cultural diversity, the younger field of anthropology diverged from philosophy. In this course we re-build a ""philosophically aware anthropology,"" and take philosophy to task, by way of inspired readings carried out in a sympathetic yet critical spirit: We discuss a selection of important philosophers' and anthropologists' writings, and interdisciplinary dialogues"

This common expression captures a widespread belief about objects' roles in human lives, but ""hearing"" what objects have to say is actually a complex cultural process. An object rarely has a single meaning; they are read variously in different cultural settings, and even by different individuals within a cultural system. How does one know -- can one know -- the meanings of an object? How are objects strategically deployed in social interaction (particularly in cross-cultural interactions, where each side may have radically different understandings)? How does one even know what an object is? We will explore the history and variety of ways that material culture and its meanings have been studied, using archaeological and ethnographic examples"

Drawing on case studies from around the world, this course attends to the complexities of heritage today. Topics include heritage ethics, tourism and the marketing of the past, approaches to preservation and management, disputed heritage and violence, heritage ideologies from nationalism to universalism, participation and inequality from the grassroots to the global, ""counterheritage"", and the practice of public archaeology.

Their authority becomes apparent in that they were constantly adapted to changing social, political, cultural, etc. conditions. Although this seems to be a widely accepted definition so far, it is deeply influenced by Greek tradition. Not only is the term mythos (word, tale) Greek, but the ubiquity of Greek gods, heroes, and their deeds in ancient literature and material culture has given myths an importance they might not have had in other cultures. This class will give an overview of the most important Greek myths and mythological figures as depicted in Greek and Roman times. The chronological frame will range from the seventh century bc to the third century ad. We will discuss the iconography of the Olympian gods and their escorts; of myths such as the loves of the gods; the battles between the Olympian Gods and the Giants, between Greeks and Amazons as well as between Lapiths and Centaurs; the Trojan War; the adventures of Odysseus; the heroic deeds of Heracles, Theseus and Perseus among others.

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

Having left us virtually no texts of their own, their history has resembled a patchwork of recollections from Old Testament and Hellenistic times. Recent archaeological discoveries, however, reveal patterns of trade, colonization and socioeconomic transformations that make the Phoenicians less enigmatic while raising new questions. Our class explores the third and second millennium Canaanite roots of the Phoenicians, as well as the Biblical and Greco-Roman perceptions of their early first millennium heyday. We will explore the Phoenician homeland and its colonies, and investigate their maritime economy, language, and religion through both archaeological and textual sources. Temporally the focus is on Phoenician rather than Carthaginian or Punic history, thus up to about 550 BCE.

ARTH 1158,FWS: Life and Death in Ancient Pompeii,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"Buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in 79 CE and rediscovered in the mid eighteenth century, Pompeii serves as an ideal model for the study of ancient Roman daily life and death.  The forums, baths, theaters, brothels, inns, taverns, homes, apartments, villas, tombs, inscriptions, graffiti, and gardens provide rich and unparalleled data on ancient life.  The city allows us to study the full spectrum of society-the elite and the poor, women, men, and children, freedman, and slaves.  In this course we will use a number of different archaeological, art historical, and literary approaches to investigate ancient life in Pompeii.  We will examine architectural remains and their decoration, ancient food, plants and animal remains, and analyses of the victims in Pompeii trapped in plaster casts"
ARTH 1160,FWS: Dangerous Women,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"Upon viewing Carolee Schneemann's Fuses, fellow avant-garde filmmaker Jonas Mekas proclaimed it the film of the year, saying, ""It is so gorgeous… so dangerous."" While Fuses was censored as pornographic, Schneemann reflects that it's lasting impact as a work of art can be attributed to how it differed from pornography, in visually conveying female pleasure: ""There's no objectification or fetishization of the woman."" In pushing boundaries of representation, Schneemann and her feminist cohort were considered dangerous, and they are not alone in the history of art. Female artists can be situated among other educated women in their presumptive ability to disrupt the natural (patriarchal) order of things. This course considers: women artists connoted as dangerous, from Frida Kahlo to Kara Walker; how women have been villainized in the visual record, from witches to suffragettes; and the pioneering scholars who uncover and interpret these issues, from Linda Nochlin to Deborah Willis. Ultimately, we will connect danger to power"

ARTH 3230,Iconography of Greek Myth,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARKEO 3130, CLASS 3727",(HA-AS),(HB),,"Myths are traditional tales. Their authority becomes apparent in that they were constantly adapted to changing social, political, cultural, etc. conditions. Although this seems to be a widely accepted definition so far, it is deeply influenced by Greek tradition. Not only is the term mythos (word, tale) Greek, but the ubiquity of Greek gods, heroes, and their deeds in ancient literature and material culture has given myths an importance they might not have had in other cultures. This class will give an overview of the most important Greek myths and mythological figures as depicted in Greek and Roman times. The chronological frame will range from the seventh century bc to the third century ad. We will discuss the iconography of the Olympian gods and their escorts; of myths such as the loves of the gods; the battles between the Olympian Gods and the Giants, between Greeks and Amazons as well as between Lapiths and Centaurs; the Trojan War; the adventures of Odysseus; the heroic deeds of Heracles, Theseus and Perseus among others. By analyzing where and when mythological images were on display it will become clear how myths were adapted to their specific context as well as why certain myths were more often depicted or more popular than others"

ARTH 6734,The Ancient Senses,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,CLASS 7734,,,,"This course will take advantage of new scholarship on the history of the senses to explore Greek and Roman culture through the perceptual capacities of the body. We will examine ancient theories of embodiment and sense-perception (with a special focus on Aristotle), as well as the ways in which cultural artefacts invited, modeled, examined, or problematized sensory relations between humans and their environments. From the hero's voice in Greek tragedy to the smells of urban Rome, and from visions of the gods to the textural qualities of language, we will take a multi-disciplinary approach. There will be a special focus on sound, in order to prepare students who may wish to take part in the 2017 CorHaLi conference at the Center for Hellenic Studies in Nafplio, Greece, but the course is open to anyone with an interest in historical approaches to the senses.

The course then turns to the modern period, considering the impact of colonialism, nationalism, and globalization upon religious ideologies and practices. The primary focus of the course will be the ethnographic study of contemporary religious practices in the region. We examine phenomena such as ritual, pilgrimage, possession, devotionalism, monasticism, asceticism, and revivalism through a series of ethnographic case studies. In so doing, we also seek to understand the impact of politics, modernity, diasporic movement, social inequality, changing gender roles, and mass mediation upon these traditions and practices"

This course will explore the many fascinating forms that this engagement took, from attempts to transform the ailing Qing dynasty into a constitutional monarchy to the establishment of a short-lived republic by Sun Yatsen, from the lionizing of ""Mr. Democracy"" during the May Fourth movement in the 1920s to the trumpeting of ""New Democracy"" by Mao Zedong twenty years later, and from movements for democratic change under Communist rule such as the Tiananmen Square protests to the flourishing of democratic ideals in the present-day Hong Kong and Taiwan.

ASIAN 2277,Meditation in Indian Culture,3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,RELST 2277,(CA-AS),(GHB),,"This course probes the truths behind traditional claims of the priority of internal practice in Indian traditions. We will examine both practices themselves - techniques of meditation and contemplation - religious ways of using intellect, forms of chant and ritual, and the dynamics through which these have left a wider mark on South Asian civilization. These dynamics include not only the evident reverberations of practice in philosophical reflection and socioreligious institutions, but also wide-ranging processes of stylization, elaboration, and popularization found throughout South Asian culture. In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts. To keep the interaction between internal practice and broader world views central, we will examine both Hindu and Buddhist sources, consistently examining the ways in which similar practices are given distinct shapes by the two religious traditions"

We will examine the ways in which Daoism was used variously to contest or legitimate imperial political power, and how the procedures and ideologies of the imperial state in turn informed Daoist theory and practice.  Throughout, we will examine the ways in which standard modern western dichotomies, such as sacred/secular, spiritual/physical, and mind/body, break down when we try to apply them to the study of Daoism.  Course will focus on the period from the fourth century B.C.E. to the thirteenth century C.E. "

A fundamental premise of this course is that any study of Tibetan Buddhism must take into consideration the implications of the dramatic events which have shaped the last sixty years of Tibetan history, and the fracture of meaning caused by the near destruction of this religious world after the communist invasion and subsequent full occupation of Tibet.  Understanding how the lens of exile and a nostalgia for a pre-Chinese invasion history shape current studies of Tibetan Buddhism will be a continuing theme throughout this course.  At the end of this course, it is hoped that students will have a grounded and nuanced understanding of the complexities of this great religious tradition, the implications of its appropriations in the western imagination as an idyllic Shangri-la, and the challenges Tibetan Buddhism faces as a diverse religious tradition as it attempts to rebuild its religious institutions in exile"

This course borrows from hip hop's notion of ""representing"" to explore popular and cultural understandings of race and place in Brooklyn as depicted in print, music, film, and online. How is Brooklyn represented? Who represents Brooklyn? What do these representations reveal about Black cultural production, inequality, and identity formation more broadly speaking? While today Brooklyn is New York City's hippest borough and the site of swift gentrification, booming real estate, and the ever-escalating displacement of immigrant and Black communities, in the 1980s and 1990s it was a hotbed of hip hop music, making the borough synonymous with Black cultural production. Now a ""global brand,"" New York's most populous borough is still the home of the nation's most concentrated Black population. The course examines Black cultural production as it relates to representations of Brooklyn. It also deconstructs images and discourses that marginalize the borough's Black residents. Spanning the period from 1945 to the present day, emphases will include the grassroots movements of the 1960s-1970s, the commodification of hip hop in the 1980s-1990s, and close readings of films including Spike Lee's ""Do the Right Thing,"" to reflect on how Black popular culture engages with Brooklyn's diverse communities.

ASRC 3220,Was US Intervention in Libya To Remove Gaddafi a Mistake?,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"GOVT 3223, NES 3223",(HA-AS),(GB),,"Questions have arisen recently about the wisdom of the 2011 Western intervention in Libya, which resulted in the removal and assassination of Colonel Gaddafi, that country's long-time ruler. The question is being asked today in relation to the political chaos that ensued and the rise in today's Libya of political movements and forces favorable or connected to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. This course is not intended to settle that question as is currently formulated. Instead, the course approaches the question of intervention in Libya in terms of the connections between global governance, the responsibility to protect, and political order and democracy in the zones of intervention. In this context, the course has two aims. The first is to contrast the approach of the African Union to the resolution of the Libyan crisis, which was summarily dismissed by the US and its allies, with the preferred approach of the Permanent Western members of the UN Security Council.  The second aim is to examine the manner in which the responsibility to protect was executed in Libya and the lessons that might be gained from it. "
ASRC 3330,Is China Recolonizing Africa?,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GOVT 3333,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"One key question about China's rise as an economic power has been what it does or is doing around the world. In this regard, China observers have taken note of emergence as the largest investors of late on the African continent. Also of significance is the fact that Chinese investments in Africa has been primarily in natural resources. This course is not about the benefits the concentration of investments in natural resources. Rather, it is about the manners in which China has defined its interests in Africa, pursued those interests, and the consequences that China's behavior for global governance, the domestic politics of African states, and the future well-being of African populations. Put into questions, the aims of this course are as follow: Should anyone should anyone worry about China's presence in Africa? Is China's presence part of the recolonizing of the Continent? Alternatively, is China's foray part of a global struggle for positioning between an emergent China and Africa's so-called traditional allies in the West? "
ASRC 3333,Ethics and Society: Aid and Its Consequences,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,PHIL 2941,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"The course looks at the connection between ethics and society.  It does so by focusing on the issues raised by the phenomenon of aid, giving or receiving it, and how we understand and react to it.  We seek to make sense of aid and its place In society.  We explore the ethics of aid from the point of view of philosophy.  We move to working through the implications of aid for (1) the giver; (2) the receiver; (3) the society, local and global; (4) the relations between individuals in a given society with respect to aid and; (5) relations between one society and its members and another society when they engage in aid-related activities"

It will introduce students to some of the major currents in the history of black radical thought, action, and organizing, with an emphasis on the United States after World War I. It relies on social, political, and intellectual history to examine the efforts of black people who have sought not merely social reform, but a fundamental restructuring of political, economic, and social relations. We will define and evaluate radicalism in the shifting contexts of liberation struggles. We will explore dissenting visions of social organization and alternative definitions of citizenship, progress, and freedom. We will confront the meaning of the intersection of race, gender, class, and sexuality in social movements"

We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Threthewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon"

In this course, we will consider how Africans and African Americans see each other through literature. What happens when two peoples suffering from double consciousness meet? We will examine the influence of historical forces including slavery, colonialism and pan-Africanism on the way writers explore the meeting between Africans and African Americans. Specifically we will look at how writers such as W.E.B DuBois, Maya Angelou, NoViolet Bulawayo, Chimamanda Adichie, Richard Wright, Eugene Robinson, Philippe Wamba, Teju Cole, and Malcolm X have understood the meeting"

We will consider topics from beatification, scarification, witchcraft, magic, and traditional medicine to the hygiene campaigns of colonialism, the development of the dermatology as a defined specialty, the rise of global health and medical humanitarianism. Descriptive ethnographic and historical texts will be read as primary evidence along side of a range of theoretical approaches to the lived body with the intention of provoking innovative readings of these primary texts and a greater understanding of the theoretical arguments"
ASRC 4115,The Willard Straight Takeover and the Legacy of Black Students,4,Graded,Spring,,,ASRC 6115,(CA-AS),,,"This course focuses on the complex history related to this famous incident from 1969 and draws on a range of materials, including some of the archival resources available in the John Henrik Clarke Library.  It is interdisciplinary and comparative in orientation and incorporates community outreach and service.  The April 19, 1969 incident known as ""the Willard Straight Takeover"" occurred during Parents' Weekend when black students occupied the student union on campus and, when threatened, returned with firearms in self-defense and also advocated for an Africana center to be developed.  When the takeover ended, the students were photographed by Steve Starr as they exited with their firearms.  The image won a Pulitzer Prize and has become iconic and world-famous.  This protest, which one of its most vocal critics has identified as a catalyst for the nation's ""culture wars,"" is one of the most important events in the history of Cornell University, even if the memory has been deeply unsettling for some.  Yet, even after nearly fifty years have passed, this event remains misunderstood, and its facts are sometimes grossly distorted or exaggerated.  Even worse, sometimes this history has been forgotten or else routinely omitted from major histories and timelines at Cornell.  In all of these respects, it is absolutely crucial to set the record straight.  The topic of the Willard Straight Takeover is one of great interest and fascination among many students.  The main goal in developing this course is to make a scholarly framework available in which they might expand and reinforce their knowledge of this topic, for so many students are curious about this history.  Black women were central in the development of this student movement from its inception, a role that is frequently discussed in relation to the incident with black female students at Wari House.  One of the goals of the course is to highlight the crucial contributions of women to the Willard Straight Takeover, which have sometimes been overlooked.  This background underscores that there is no one history or narrative of the Willard Straight Takeover incident, but many overlapping histories, and that gender, race, and class have been central factors in constituting them.  Architecture, even, past and present, plays a central role in shaping perceptions of and myths about this event.  Given the importance of outreach, building coalitions and supporting a range of peer fields on campus, this course will also serve as a vital context for reinforcing knowledge of the Latino Day Hall Takeover in 1993 during the Thanksgiving Break, which occurred to discuss the possibility for creating a Latino Living Center and a Latino Studies Program.  An important aspect as we proceed will be investigating the black student movement in national and global perspective and its relation to the civil rights and Black Power movement, from San Francisco State to Jackson State and beyond.  Our campus libraries, including the John Henrik Clark Library at the Africana Center, hold a wealth of resources in a range of genres related to this incident, including films and videos, essays, photographs, interviews, and articles.  Students will explore these materials as a way of gaining a basic historical introduction to this incident.  In the process, they will reinforce their skills for analyzing and interpreting various media and archival materials.  An added benefit of this course it that it is also designed to reinforce skills that they are building in a diverse range of academic coursework, along with their technological literacies.  This course honors and pays tribute to the history and meaning of the Willard Straight Takeover in 1969 as an event that was not only about Cornell, but also drew in the Ithaca community.  A priority will be to facilitate the development of student projects and community outreach initiatives"
ASRC 4291,Marriage and Divorce in the African Context,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"FGSS 4291, FGSS 6291, HIST 4291, HIST 6291",(HA-AS),(GB),,"Marriage was the widely expected norm within African societies. The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage"

We will address questions including: How can we use anthropology and oral history to influence public policies on education, housing, police practices and income inequality? How do differences in positionality  (i.e. race, class, gender, age) between the interviewer and the interviewee affect the production of ethnography and oral history?  The course will include travel to New York City and will require a significant commitment to engaged-learning. "
ASRC 4513,Science Fiction and the Value of Utopia/Dystopia,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4513, ENGL 4903",(LA-AS),,,"A pronounced turn away from utopian discourses has long been felt across multiple academic registers—aspects of queer theory rejecting futurity, portions of the radical left adopting a similar politics of no future, and scholars in African-American studies debating the idea of an Afro-pessimism, to name just a few examples. This accumulation of tragic thought brings the question: Does the utopian text no longer hold any value in the development of alternative political thought? This course, grounded in science fiction, will address this question via the thoughtful examination of a range of theoretical, fictional, and cinematic texts. Works to be studied throughout the semester will come from, among others, Frederick Jameson, Carlos Fuentes, Aldous Huxley, Alfonso Cuarón, Colson Whitehead, and Samuel Delany"

Considering questions of performance, censorship, embodiment, pleasure, and representational politics, we will evaluate how race, particularly Black skin, has been used as a signifier and complex code for various things on screen. In doing so, we will investigate how blackness is contingent on the specifics of its historical, social, and cultural production and, yet, open to multiple and competing claims. Therefore, blackness here is less a stable racial category than theoretical motor, operated by moving and contested discourses, histories, images, meanings, and performances by Black subjects. Focusing on Black skin representation and discourses of blackness as a cultural signifier, students will watch and discuss important representations and misrepresentations of blackness on screen"

Some central questions include: What is the lived geography of the Caribbean at different moments, and how does using different geographic and temporal frameworks help approach the region's history? What role did people living in this amorphously demarcated region play in major historical transformations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? How did the varied, but interconnected processes of Caribbean emancipation impact economic and political systems throughout the Atlantic and beyond?

African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class.

The instructor will educate the students about the clinical environment, dress and behavior code, interaction with hospital staff and patients, as well as monitor and manage each student-preceptor team. The instructor and other engineering faculty will also review the student's experiences and assist in any assignments the preceptor may have given to the student. The preceptor will guide the student with in depth knowledge of the related anatomy, physiology and pathology associated with his specialty. The preceptor will also provide the student the ability to participate and observe as well as generate weekly assignments. The sponsoring institution and the preceptors are very interested in the identified problems, the ideas resultant of the process, and how these ideas could be addressed by applying principles of engineering. The student will provide feedback in the form of a final report as well as an on-site poster presentation at the end of the academic year. The merited ideas will be placed in the pipeline for the sponsored design projects (BME 5910, BME 5920)"

Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"
BSOC 2131,Science Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 2035, ENGL 2035, STS 2131",(CA-AS),(GB),,"Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is ""the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality."" Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future"

Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague to the rise and fall of hysteria to depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications? Readings will include a broad range of genres, including poetry (Dickinson, Whitman, Keats), fiction (McEwan, Chekhov, Gilman, Kafka, Camus), theater (Kushner), nonfiction prose (Woolf, Freud), and critical theory (Foucault, Scarry, Canguilhem, Sontag)"
BSOC 2468,"Medicine, Culture, and Society",3,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ANTHR 2468, FGSS 2468, STS 2468",(CA-AS),,,"Medicine has become the language and practice through which we address a broad range of both individual and societal complaints. Interest in this ""medicalization of life"" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine"
BSOC 2581,Environmental History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2581, HIST 2581",(HA-AS),(HB),,"This lecture course serves as an introduction to the historical study of humanity's interrelationship with the natural world. Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

Changing perceptions of nature and human knowledge from Greek Antiquity to the twentieth century form the framework for current Western views of the world, while the roots of the present-day dominance of ""science"" as a symbol of progress and modernity lie in an alliance between knowledge of nature and power over nature that took shape in the nineteenth century after a long period of emergence. This course covers the eighteenth, nineteenth, and early twentieth centuries.   "
BSOC 3111,Sociology of Medicine,4,Graded,Spring,,,"DSOC 3111, SOC 3130, STS 3111",(SBA-AS),,,"This course provides an introduction to the ways in which medical practice, the medical profession, and medical technology are embedded in society and culture. We will ask how medicine is connected to various sociocultural factors such as gender, social class, race, and administrative cultures. We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. We will also read various classic and contemporary texts that speak to the illness experience and the culture of surgeons, hospitals, and patients, and we will discuss various case studies in the social construction of physical and mental illness"
BSOC 3181,"Living in an Uncertain World: Science, Technology, and Risk",4,Graded,Spring,,,"HIST 3181, STS 3181",(HA-AS),,,"This course explores the history, sociology, and ethics of risk. In particular, we will focus on the complex and often ambiguous relationship between science, technology, and risk. A historical perspective shows how science and technology have generated risks while they have also played key roles in managing and solving those very risks. By examining several case studies, including 19th-century mining, the 1911 Triangle fire, nuclear science, the space shuttle disasters, asbestos litigation, Hurricane Katrina, and the contemporary financial crisis, we will consider how risk and ideas about risk have changed over time. By exploring different historical and cultural responses to risk, we will examine the sociopolitical dimensions of the definitions, perceptions, and management of risk both in the past and the present"
BSOC 3481,British Romanticism,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 3400,,,,"With the exhilarating and terrifying historical ""experiments"" of the French and American Revolutions in the background, English Romantic writers tackled the question of the personal and political effects of literary experimentation. They did so in dialogue with new methods of experimental science that were unsettling traditional conceptions of thinking, feeling, nature and social progress. Could new literary techniques have revolutionary or reactionary effects, or elude the very logic of cause and effect? Might poems and novels alter routines of perception or harbor lost histories and futures? Such possibilities for ""experiment"" will guide this survey of Romantic literature, from poetic neuroscience to the Revolution controversy and experimental writing from Blake, the Shelleys, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Burke, Goethe, Baillie and Barbauld"

This course looks not only at animals in their social lives, but also at animals in their lives with us. We ask questions about how species become entangled and what that means for both parties, about the social lives of animals independently and with humans, about the survival of human and animal species, and about what it means to use animals for science, food, and profit. The course draws on readings from Anthropology, Science & Technology Studies, and animal trainers and behaviorists"
BSOC 4431,"Victorian Literature and Psychology: Madness, Monstrosity and the Science of Mind",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 4430,,,,"This course examines a range of nineteenth-century British literature, focusing on how Victorian writers represented the workings of the human mind. In particular, we examine how novels (and a few poems) trace the development of subjectivity in a variety of genres, while also reading selections from psychological texts of the period. In these works, we study Victorian interest in the relation between the self and society as it emerges through sympathy, memory, emotion, reverie, obsession, hysteria, monomania, insanity, and double consciousness. We will also evaluate how well more recent psychological concepts like trauma can elucidate Victorian texts. Readings may include Charlotte Brontë, Villette; Robert Browning, selected poems; Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White; Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Lady Audley's Secret; George Eliot, Daniel Deronda; Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Barton; Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Tennyson, Maud"

It covers the main topics and questions regarding bodies, diseases, and medical institutions within the framework of major historical developments in world and region's history. The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

Socrates finds their claims underwhelming and inadequate as the basis of real happiness. To even the odds, we will also read a number of short contemporary works that support Protagoras' side. The course will follow Plato's intense focus on methods of debate and analysis.

In this course, we will examine a variety of social, political, economic, and cultural perspectives on Ptolemaic Egypt and its relationships with the rest of the Mediterranean world. Topics include (1) the political and economic history of Ptolemaic Egypt; (2) the multicultural character of Ptolemaic society; (3) the interaction of Greek and Egyptian religious systems, and the creation of ""fusion"" gods; (4) Ptolemaic relations with the rest of the Hellenistic world and beyond; and (5) the relevance of Ptolemaic Egypt to an understanding of modern phenomena such as globalism, tourism, and colonialism"

The study of frescoes offers an exciting means of tackling important questions relating to Roman social history (issues of class, gender, familial and political structures), while inviting us to explore visual themes such as the relationship between art and nature, the use of myth, the spatial dynamics of domestic decorative schemes and concepts of ornament"

CLASS 3727,Iconography of Greek Myth,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ARKEO 3130, ARTH 3230",(HA-AS),(HB),,"Myths are traditional tales. Their authority becomes apparent in that they were constantly adapted to changing social, political, cultural, etc. conditions. Although this seems to be a widely accepted definition so far, it is deeply influenced by Greek tradition. Not only is the term mythos (word, tale) Greek, but the ubiquity of Greek gods, heroes, and their deeds in ancient literature and material culture has given myths an importance they might not have had in other cultures. This class will give an overview of the most important Greek myths and mythological figures as depicted in Greek and Roman times. The chronological frame will range from the seventh century bc to the third century ad. We will discuss the iconography of the Olympian gods and their escorts; of myths such as the loves of the gods; the battles between the Olympian Gods and the Giants, between Greeks and Amazons as well as between Lapiths and Centaurs; the Trojan War; the adventures of Odysseus; the heroic deeds of Heracles, Theseus and Perseus among others. By analyzing where and when mythological images were on display it will become clear how myths were adapted to their specific context as well as why certain myths were more often depicted or more popular than others"

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities. This course will address current theories about identity and its formation, discuss the various facets of identity (e.g. gender, religion, ethnicity) in the Greek and Roman worlds, and introduce tools for studying identity in the past"

Readings and viewings include plays from the ancient, medieval, early modern, and modern periods; films by Peter Greenaway, Jenny Livingston, and Jim Jarmusch; and performances by Karen Finley and Marina Abramovic.

Originating from present-day Lebanon, they were Semitic speakers, renowned seafarers and transmitters of an innovative alphabet that transformed how Mediterranean and Near Eastern folk wrote their languages. Having left us virtually no texts of their own, their history has resembled a patchwork of recollections from Old Testament and Hellenistic times. Recent archaeological discoveries, however, reveal patterns of trade, colonization and socioeconomic transformations that make the Phoenicians less enigmatic while raising new questions. Our class explores the third and second millennium Canaanite roots of the Phoenicians, as well as the Biblical and Greco-Roman perceptions of their early first millennium heyday. We will explore the Phoenician homeland and its colonies, and investigate their maritime economy, language, and religion through both archaeological and textual sources. Temporally the focus is on Phoenician rather than Carthaginian or Punic history, thus up to about 550 BCE.

In this class, we seek the strange and wondrous otherness, along with the familiar and wondrous sameness in modern literature from the Middle East. We proceed thematically across the literary traditions of the Middle East, with a focus on works written in Arabic, Turkish, Persian, and Hebrew. The thematic organization permits us to approach critical issues comparatively. In addition to exploring the tension between Eastern and Western influences in this literature, we will also investigate other issues writers confront: How do literary heritage and religious tradition inflect modern texts?

The flight of the gods and the death of God have supposedly left a disenchanted world with little room for the sacred. However, in this class we will study modern European writers, artists, and philosophers who rejected conventional religion but held fast to a concept of the divine or the holy. In particular, we will trace the desire for a ""new mythology"" and examine critically the transition from religious art to art as religion, in which the artistic genius is deified. Were these currents radical or reactionary? Are enchantment and enthusiasm compatible with atheism and materialism? What is the price of Enlightenment and what are the risks of resisting it? Helping us answer these questions will be authors like Blake, Hölderlin, Wackenroder, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Yeats, George, Rilke, and Mann. We will also read philosophy by Nietzsche, Heidegger, Eliade, Blumenberg, Girard, and Derrida. In addition, we will experience Wagner's Parsifal and look at a wealth of visual art"

Focusing on Franz Kafka's novels and tales, we will examine topics such as: the relationship between body and pain; society and the individual; authority and hierarchy; fathers and sons; writing and living; language and home; music and politics; and religion and persecution. Placing Kafka first within the socio-cultural context of Jewish-German-Czech Prague (and discussing problems of multicultural-lingual identity), we shall follow his literary journey to his vision of America (one of his novels).

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively. We also consider how these three writers have been fused into a single constellation, 'Marx-Nietzsche-Freud,' and how they have been interpreted by others, including L. Althusser, A. Badiou, A.

Taking its cue from the ""digital turn,"" this course rephrases a traditional question asked in film theory about the nature of the medium (What is film?) in terms of a historical question: What was film when it was still something to be cut, wound up, and carried around, a thing with a literally explosive potential? Reframing the object of study in this manner will help situate familiar narrative cinema within more unfamiliar scientific, aesthetic, and experimental contexts. Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929)"

COML 4414,The Sound of Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GERST 4414,(LA-AS),(HB),,"When we speak, we think of our voice as natural to us. This course will interrogate the basis of this assumption by focusing on the voice as a trained cultural technique.  In this course, we will look at the history of this topic from Plato to Nietzsche through close critical readings of literary and philosophical depictions of listening and acoustic performances up to and prior to the age of the phonograph. How did philosophers, pastors, and poets describe, observe, imagine sound before sounds could be recorded? Were there particular modes of listening or speaking more appropriate for the ""right"" kind of literary or philosophical understanding? How did listening intersect with the visual apprehension of the printed page, painting or sculpture? How do vocal techniques construct either a national culture or other types of communities? Readings will include texts by Plato, Lucretius, Augustine, Rousseau, Goethe, Klopstock, Herder, Nietzsche, Michel de Certeau, Friedrich Kittler, Michel Chion, and Walter Ong"

This accumulation of tragic thought brings the question: Does the utopian text no longer hold any value in the development of alternative political thought? This course, grounded in science fiction, will address this question via the thoughtful examination of a range of theoretical, fictional, and cinematic texts. Works to be studied throughout the semester will come from, among others, Frederick Jameson, Carlos Fuentes, Aldous Huxley, Alfonso Cuarón, Colson Whitehead, and Samuel Delany"

The relationship between technology and tradition reevaluates established assumptions between representation, power and the gaze. Decolonizing methodologies will establish the translatability of Indigenous oral tradition to visual expression as a form of cultural agency.

COML 6032,Writing the Self,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GERST 6210,,,,"The ""autobiographical"" spans millennia and encompasses a vast array of seemingly dissimilar authors and modes of writing: Marcus Aurelius' Meditations, Augustine's and Rousseau's Confessions, Montaigne's Essays, Pepys' diaries, Goethe's Poetry and Truth, Freud's letters to Fliess accompanying his self-analysis, the corpus of diaries from Amiel to Kafka and Woolf to Warhol or Susan Sontag and Roland Barthes. In this course, we will investigate the emergence of writing a self out of practices such as ascetic (in the Foucauldian sense) self-exploration and confession and the risks of introspection under conditions of secularization. We will explore theories of the autobiographical but also ask what kind of artistic practices and theoretical fields have emerged from genres like autobiography or diary (projects like cartographies in Perec or Ernaux; notions like aesthetics or ethics of everyday life). What stabilizing or destabilizing functions does writing the self serve? Is the ‚I' merely framed by narrative conventions, space and time (Blanchot), or can it find ways to mediate self and world, individual and society in writing?"

In this course we will study the linguistic anthropologist Michael Silverstein and his ""pragmatic"" linguistics in relation to free indirect discourse, Bakhtinian register, and Foucauldian author functions to consider how texts work in the world. Examining books from Manuel Puig, David Foster Wallace, Miguel Barnet, Andy Warhol, Lydia Davis and others that take the form of an interview, we will study the maneuvers of spoken conversation in print.

How do images produce meaning? How has vision been defined historically and methodologically? How has visual culture been construed theoretically? Our goal will be to sketch the genealogical trajectories that comprise visual studies as a field of investigation by focusing on concerns that have shaped larger theoretical debates on the politics and ethics of representation, including mimesis, realism, perspective, the interplay of word and image, attention, spectacle, and surveillance. Readings will be drawn from influential works in visual theory, cultural semiotics and anthropology, media studies, and the science of vision.

Despite recent claims, geographic proximity in social interactions has never been more important. How do we introduce space into our models for planning analysis? Why are things as they are? How do we evaluate plans/policies when spatial interactions matter? The course addresses these questions drawing on recent advances in spatial modeling. The methods to be discussed include the framework of inter-regional input-output (IRIO), structural path analysis (SPA), computable general equilibrium (CGE), and agent-based modeling (ABM). We will begin with the top-down IMPLAN analyses, which are appropriate for static, short-term planning challenges, but less so for regions and cities that change continuously. Regions and cities are adaptive, self-organizing systems of individuals whose interdependent actions create urban forms and produce spatial patterns. To explore how macro-patterns emerge from micro-behavior, we will discuss the bottom-up framework of agent-based modeling. The models to be discussed are analytically intractable: results can only be derived using numerical simulations. The analysis therefore requires computer packages, including IMPLAN, Excel, GAMS, and NetLogo. "

Conceived as a uniquely European phenomenon that spread to the rest of the world through the impact of colonial empires and the world market, it also supplies the normative frameworks for many contemporary theories of development. This conception of modernity, and the meta-theories that legitimate it, has been the subject of increasingly heated scholarly controversy.

EDUC 5020,Education and Development in Africa,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 6600,,,,"In the 1950s and 1960s, the human capital theory that emphasizes the importance of formal education for achievement of full productive potential of individuals and economic growth and development of countries enjoyed a renewed popularity. African countries promoted educational expansion with the expectation that it would lead to socio-economic development. The initial euphoria, however, was followed by skepticism and then disillusion.  Education, as it was being organized, delivered, received, and utilized, began to be perceived even as a hindrance to development. The course examines the relationship between formal education and individual and national development. Different paradigms of development, including modernization and dependency theories, and Third World Forum, are discussed with an emphasis on the perceived and actual roles of education in individual and national development. The issues to be discussed include education and schooling, the role of primary, secondary, and higher education in development, the problems of employment, language, equity in access and results with a focus on gender, race, and social class. Case studies, including selected countries of the different African sub-regions, will be used for illustration"

In this course, we'll examine how well-known authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Alison Bechdel, Tim O'Brien, and others construct their public, written selves. We'll also consider how the style of writing affects how readers understand an author's personality and motives. Readings will include short essays, possible some poems, and a few longer works. Through the writing frequent essays, we'll explore why and how people write about themselves—for self-exploration, political or social change, purely to practice a form of art, or for other reasons—and we'll investigate how writing shapes lived experience"

In this course, we'll study and write about the nature of narratives, taking the classic mystery tale written by such writers as Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Chandler as typical of intricately plotted stories of suspense and disclosure that have been written and filmed in many genres: Greek tragedy, horror tales by Poe and Shirley Jackson, psychological thrillers by Ruth Rendell and Patricia Highsmith, neo-noir films such as Memento and Fight Club, and postmodern mystery parodies such as those of Paul Auster and Jorge Luis Borges.

What are the differences between literary and visual media? What can the juxtaposition of word and image teach us about the nature of representation? What other kinds of ends (satiric, esoteric, etc.) do artists and writers hope to achieve by coupling words with images? To explore these questions, we will consult works drawn from a range of periods and genres (for example, graphic novels, medieval manuscripts, contemporary art and new media, emblem books, film, literary gaming, fiction and poetry).

ENGL 2020,Inventing Modern Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Does the modern drive to ""make it new"" mean rejecting every precedent, or sifting the archive for past fragments that glimmer under present circumstances? This course surveys 250 years of English literary innovation, from the heyday of classical imitation, through defiant Romantic ""returns"" to artlessness, up to modernist experiments in narrative time. What does the most recent half of the English literary tradition have to teach us about our culture's obsession with innovation and ""disruption""? What has it meant to be ""new""? Lectures and weekly discussions teach skills of reading and writing about literature at the collegiate level. Texts will include Swift, Keats, Brönte, Yeats, Hopkins, Woolf, Bishop and Adrienne Rich, among many, many others"
ENGL 2035,Science Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"BSOC 2131, COML 2035, STS 2131",(CA-AS),(GB),,"Science fiction, as Fredric Jameson put it, is ""the only kind of literature that can reach back and colonize reality."" Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future"

We will consider a wide range of authors and literary movements while paying close attention to radical shifts in American culture in the past century and a half.

How does this writing engage central issues of modern American culture such as race, immigration, class mobility, and technology? The class will examine a variety of genres including poetry, novels, manifestos, and drama. Authors include Mark Twain, Kate Chopin, T.S.

Can a poem or a novel palliate pain, illness, even the possibility of death? From darkly comic narratives of black plague to the rise and fall of hysteria to depictions of the AIDS crisis, this course examines literature centered on medical practices from the early modern period through the twentieth century. Why have medical practices changed, and how do writers address their political, social, and ideological implications?

Within the historical context of the Holocaust and how and why it occurred, we shall examine major and widely read Holocaust narratives that have shaped the way we understand and respond to the Holocaust. We also study ethical and psychological issues about how and why people behave in dire circumstances. We shall begin with first-person reminiscences—Wiesel's Night, Levi's Survival at Auschwitz, and The Diary of Anne Frank—before turning to realistic fictions such as Kineally's Schindler's List (and Spielberg's film), Kertesz's Fateless, Kosinski's The Painted Bird, and Ozick's ""The Shawl.""

ENGL 2605,"Cannibals, Vampires, Colonizers, and Other Fearsome Figures in Native American Literature",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"Native American depictions of human interactions with frightening beings can help readers appreciate Indigenous perspectives and experiences. That is, when contemporary Indigenous writers repurpose features of gothic, fantasy, sci-fi, or environmentalist fiction, their reimagined insatiable antagonists are almost universally formed as critical representations of colonialism, while monstrosity emerges from transgressions against Indigenous values and relationships. In reading for this course, we'll examine Indigenous depictions of voracious beings, the relationships these fearsome figures attempt to disrupt, and the means by which protagonists fight their demons. Through the lens of critical Indigenous theory and a sampling of short stories, novels, ethnographies, historical readings, and films, this course will examine how Native American authors continue a long-established practice of balancing relationships through storytelling and story-writing"
ENGL 2650,Introduction to African American Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 2650, ASRC 2650","(D-AG, CA-AS)",,,"This course will introduce students to the African American literary tradition.

From slave narratives to Hip-Hop music, we will trace the range of artistic conventions and cultural movements while paying close attention to broader historical shifts in American life over the past three centuries. We will ask: How do authors create and define a tradition? What are some of the recurring themes and motifs within this tradition? Authors will include: David Walker, Frederick Douglass, Ida B. Wells-Barnett, W.E.B. DuBois, Zora Neale Hurston, Lorraine Hansberry, James Baldwin, Toni Morrison, Claudia Rankine, and Chimamanda Adichie"

It is as if I had words instead of fingers, or fingers at the tip of my words. My language trembles with desire."" Sexual desire has a history, even a literary history, which we will examine through an introductory survey of European dramatic literature from Plato and Aristophanes to Jean Genet and Caryl Churchill, as well as a survey of classic readings in Western sexual theory from the Ancient Greeks through Sigmund Freud and Michel Foucault to recent feminist and queer theory"
ENGL 2775,Censorship: Milton to Wiki-Leaks,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"In democratic societies, freedom of expression is both a cultural value and protected right. And yet, governments also routinely regulate speech through a variety of mechanisms: from direct censorship, to licensing and copyright laws, to high court decisions about what qualifies as ""speech.""  This course will survey the history of free expression and the free press from the late 16th-century to the present day through a series of case studies on authors and topics ranging from Milton and Defoe to Joyce and Rushdie; from music, intellectual property, and the parody of 2 Live Crew  to corporate speech; from ""seditious libel"" to Wiki-Leaks; and from slander and hate speech to obscenity and pornography. We will consider how the categories of dangerous speech, and thresholds of toleration, have changed over time.

ENGL 2870,Freedom Writes: Literature of Global Justice Struggles,4,Graded,Fall,,,ASRC 2870,(LA-AS),,,"This course examines some major justice movements of the modern era, introducing students to a submerged history that should neither be idealized nor forgotten. One goal will be to connect the ongoing struggles for social justice of minoritized populations in the US with the history of struggles for justice by workers, women, and disempowered social groups across the world. We'll begin with the work of Martin Luther King, Jr., Malcolm X, and Gandhi, and conclude with a look at contemporary activist movements.  Along the way, we'll look at such cultural forms as AIDS quilts, urban murals, the music of Bob Marley, and theatrical productions from prisons, as well as Anna Deveare Smith's Twilight L.A. and Helena Viramontes' novel Under the Feet of Jesus"
ENGL 2890,Expository Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"ENGL 2890 offers guidance and an audience for students who wish to gain skill in expository writing—a common term for critical, reflective, investigative, and creative nonfiction.

Course members will read in relevant published material and write and revise their own work regularly, while reviewing and responding to one another's. Students and instructors will confer individually throughout the term. Topics differ for each section"
ENGL 2901,Utopia: From Thomas More to Science Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"A ""utopia"" is an imaginary world, a fantastical ""no-place"" that conveys important truths about the real world. This course surveys the literary genre of utopia from the Renaissance to today, focusing on writers who invent new worlds through fiction. In Thomas More's Utopia, we explore utopia's emergence in the sixteenth century in response to European political upheaval and New World exploration, then turn to how British and American writers transform utopian visions in the following centuries. Finally, we consider how utopia is re-worked in science fiction's paradoxical emphasis on both fantasy and realism. Topics include the politics of gender and the purpose of technology in a perfect society, and the wildly inventive forms of utopian fiction by Shakespeare, Margaret Cavendish, Jonathan Swift, Aldous Huxley, Ursula LeGuin, and Philip K. Dick"
ENGL 2907,Media Studies: Photography/Paper/Film/Code,4,Graded,Spring,,,COML 2007,(CA-AS),,,"Is a photograph of an event somehow more real than a written report? Will the novel survive the age of new media? How do Instagram or Twitter change storytelling? In this class we will examine how media including film, radio, photography, smart phones, and even paper have been taken up by artists and writers to revolutionize representation. Studying visual, sonic and textual artists from across the world, we will explore how media affect the history of sensation and experience, how different media create alternative ways to compose narratives, and how media artists and activists conscious of gender, race, and class have shaped how we use a technology to make it into a medium. Authors and artists include Barthes, Sontag, Chun, L. Clark, McLuhan"
ENGL 2910,It's All Chinese to Me,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AAS 2910, AMST 2910",(CA-AS),,,"In her memoir Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong Kingston identified a conundrum familiar to many US-born children of Chinese immigrants when she asked: ""What is Chinese tradition and what is the movies?"" What is ""Chinese tradition""? Does it mean the same thing to people in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or to Chinese diasporic communities in North America?  Does ""Chineseness"" change across time and space? While there will be occasion to discuss what ""Chineseness"" means in different Asian contexts, this course will focus primarily on how ideas of ""China"" and ""Chineseness"" have been historically constructed by, for, and in the West—particularly in the US. Course materials include readings on the concept of ""Chineseness,"" Chinese American literature and film, and historical studies of East/West relations"
ENGL 3021,Literary Theory on the Edge,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 3021, PMA 3421",(LA-AS),,,"This course juxtaposes the exciting theoretical advances of the late 20th century, including structuralism and post-structuralism, with current developments in 21st century theory such as performance studies, media theory, digital studies, trauma theory, transgender studies, and ecocriticsm. Taught by two Cornell professors active in the field, along with occasional invited guests, lectures and class discussions will pay close attention to the differences among mediatic systems in the texts we read as well as the uniqueness and complexity of language in its various forms. The course may involve presentation of performance art"
ENGL 3120,Beowulf,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6120, MEDVL 3120, MEDVL 6120",(LA-AS),(HB),,"In recent years, Beowulf has received renewed attention in popular culture, thanks to the production of two recent Beowulf movies and riveting new translations (eg. Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"
ENGL 3260,Spenser and the Faerie Queene,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Edmund Spenser is the major Elizabethan writer other than Shakespeare who most influenced English poetry. But students often don't know him, even though, in a way, they have already encountered him: Spenser's grand epic poem, The Faerie Queene, is often seen as a major source of contemporary fantasy literature and even of the plotting of video games. As we will see in this course, it is more - much - more than that. Knights (both male and female) are tested in perilous quests and some very strange figures are encountered  in this complex and intellectually challenging work, a beautifully weird, many-stranded narrative and a fascinating mind-trip through wayward desires and monstrous fears. "
ENGL 3330,Fictions of Self-Invention: The Eighteenth Century Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"If the Satanic fantasy is to believe ourselves ""Self-begot, self-raised by our own quick'ning power,"" as Milton says, then the early novel is diabolical. Foundlings and orphans, abandoned wives, abducted daughters, incestuous marriages, exiled or restlessly traveling sons: early fiction imagines the possibility of socially inventing ourselves by challenging and leaving behind both the family defined by birth and a place called home. We will examine the ideology of self-invention—its promotion of individual autonomy through education, culture, sex, and economics—in such novels as Defoe's Moll Flanders, Haywood's Love in Excess, Fielding's Tom Jones, Austen's Emma. We will also examine how fiction tries to invent itself by turning to forms of realism and forgetting the history of literature"
ENGL 3400,British Romanticism,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,BSOC 3481,(LA-AS),(HB),,"With the exhilarating and terrifying historical ""experiments"" of the French and American Revolutions in the background, English Romantic writers tackled the question of the personal and political effects of literary experimentation. They did so in dialogue with new methods of experimental science that were unsettling traditional conceptions of thinking, feeling, nature and social progress. Could new literary techniques have revolutionary or reactionary effects, or elude the very logic of cause and effect? Might poems and novels alter routines of perception or harbor lost histories and futures? Such possibilities for ""experiment"" will guide this survey of Romantic literature, from poetic neuroscience to the Revolution controversy and experimental writing from Blake, the Shelleys, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Burke, Goethe, Baillie and Barbauld"
ENGL 3430,The Brontës,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Sheltered daughters of an Irish clergyman, isolated in a remote village in England, the Brontë sisters produced some of the most violent, shocking, sophisticated, and popular fiction of the nineteenth century. Their works and lives sparked so much interest from their own time to ours that every generation of readers has had something to say, including cartoonists and film directors. We will read novels by the three sisters (including Jane Eyre, Wuthering Heights, The Tenant of Wildfell Hall, and Villette) alongside Elizabeth Gaskell's Life of Charlotte Brontë, the first contemporary biography of a woman writer.

Through their celebration of ""art for art's sake"" and all that was considered artificial, unnatural, or obscene, the Decadent writers of the late-nineteenth century sought to free the pleasures of beauty, spirituality, and sexual desire from their more conventional ethical moorings. We will focus on the literature of the period, including works by Charles Baudelaire, Edgar Allan Poe, A. C. Swinburne, and especially Oscar Wilde, and we will also consider related developments in aesthetic philosophy, painting, music, theater, architecture, and design"

When and to what degree do children participate in the construction of these representations? This course surveys a variety of contemporary media texts (television, film, and the internet) aimed at children ranging in age from pre-kindergarten to young adults. We explore how these texts seek to construct children as empowered consumers, contesting adult conformity. Our theoretical approach complicates definitions of childhood as a time of innocence and potential victimhood and challenges normative constructions of childhood as a time for establishing ""proper"" sexual and gender identities. Taking a cultural studies approach, the class will consider the connections between the cultural texts and the realms of advertising, toys, and gaming"
ENGL 3606,Black Women and Political Leadership,3,Stdnt Opt,,,,"ASRC 3206, FGSS 3206",,,,"This course studies the life experiences and political struggles of black women who have attained political leadership across the African Diaspora.

Authors include Nathaniel Hawthorne, Herman Melville, Edith Wharton, Pauline Hopkins, and Fanny Fern"
ENGL 3725,Femininity as Masquerade,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"FGSS 3725, LGBT 3725",(LA-AS),,,"""One is not born a woman, but rather becomes one"" wrote Simone de Beauvoir. How does such an odd becoming happen? What can literature teach us about it? Does anyone ever achieve ""being a woman"" and how do we (""we""??) survive always falling short of the implicit ideal? We will think about the power afforded by receptivity, passivity, bottoming, emotionality and openness, whether or not these are enacted by people born, designated or living as female.  What are some of the dimensions of femininity's diversity, even in the United States, today? This course is intimately informed by intersectional queer, women of color and trans* perspectives, which will be at the center of our inquiry. It will cover film, literature, personal essays and gender theory"

We will consider how new generations of black poets are using verse to represent personal and collective history; to interrogate race and other social categories like gender and sexuality; and to ungate new perspectives for understanding the human condition. Along with verse, we will also study other forms of poetry like Hip Hop and spoken word that inform the contemporary African American lyric. Authors will include Rita Dove, Yusef Komunyakaa, Elisabeth Alexander, Natasha Threthewey, Terrance Hayes, and Lyrae Van Clief-Stefanon"

In this course, we will consider how Africans and African Americans see each other through literature. What happens when two peoples suffering from double consciousness meet? We will examine the influence of historical forces including slavery, colonialism and pan-Africanism on the way writers explore the meeting between Africans and African Americans. Specifically we will look at how writers such as W.E.B DuBois, Maya Angelou, NoViolet Bulawayo, Chimamanda Adichie, Richard Wright, Eugene Robinson, Philippe Wamba, Teju Cole, and Malcolm X have understood the meeting"
ENGL 3755,"Literature, Trauma, and Culture",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,COML 3024,(LA-AS),,,"This is an introduction to trauma theory in the context of the concerns of the contemporary world. We will study the unique and enigmatic notion of trauma as it arose in the beginning of the twentieth century in the work of Sigmund Freud, focusing on the temporal structure of trauma as well as the implications of deferred experience for a thinking of history. The course will emphasize the literary dimension of trauma theory but also its relevance for (and modification in light of) current concerns with nuclearism, terrorism, racism, and environmental catastrophe. Texts by Sigmund Freud, Jean Laplanche, Jacques Derrida, Shoshana Felman, Francoise Davoine, Robert Jay Lifton, among others, and some literature and film"

ENGL 3860,Philosophic Fictions,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"""Fictions"" of thought and language abound in all good writing, especially in works that deliberately test and play with ideas: dialogues, satires, parables, philosophic tales, and ""thought-experiments."" Students will write critically about such works and will experiment with writing in similar forms in order to argue flexibly, ridicule vice and folly, or involve readers in pleasingly or disturbingly insoluble problems.

ENGL 3890,The Personal Voice: Nonfiction Writing,4,Graded,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Writers of creative nonfiction plumb the depths of their experience and comment memorably on the passing scene. They write reflectively on themselves and journalistically on the activities and artifacts of others. The voice they seek is at once uniquely personal, objectively persuasive, and accessible to others who want relish their view of the world and learn from it. This course is for the maturely self-motivated writer (beyond the first year of college) who wants to experiment with style and voice to find new writerly personae in a workshop environment. During the semester, we'll read enabling models of literary nonfiction, including one another's, and work to develop a portfolio of diverse and polished writing"
ENGL 4020,Literature as Moral Inquiry,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"What can literary works, especially novels, tell us about moral issues? Should they be seen as suggesting a form of moral inquiry similar to the kind of philosophical discussion we get in, say, Aristotle's Nicomachean Ethics? Can reading philosophical works in ethics together with novels that deal with similar themes help us understand these themes better? This course is an attempt to answer these questions. We will read selections from Aristotle, Kant, Marx, and Nietzsche, and use these works to help us understand the nature of moral inquiry in novels like Eliot's Middlemarch, Coetzee's Disgrace, Morrison's Beloved, Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway, Conrad's Heart of Darkness, and Achebe's Things Fall Apart. Other writers we will most probably read include Nadine Gordimer, Doris Lessing, and Kazuo Ishiguro"

ENGL 4150,Piers Plowman and the Pearl Poet,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"ENGL 6150, MEDVL 4150, MEDVL 6150",(LA-AS),(HB),,"In this course we will focus on two major non-Chaucerian Middle English poets, the Pearl-poet and William Langland, the author of Piers Plowman. We will focus on close, linguistically careful reading of these poets in Middle English and graduate students will be encouraged to submit a research paper on some aspect of these texts. Some experience with Old or Middle English, such as Introductory Old English or a Chaucer course, would be helpful for students who might take the course, but students who would like to use the course as an introduction to Middle English are more than welcome. These are two of the finest poets in any era of English literature.

ENGL 4291,American Shakespeare,4,Graded,,,,"AMST 4194, PMA 4190",,,,"What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton. While encountering a number of plays, students will have the opportunity to see at least three live performances and numerous movies, consider the history of Shakespeare in America and learn from actors, directors, scholars and designers"

In particular, we examine how novels (and a few poems) trace the development of subjectivity in a variety of genres, while also reading selections from psychological texts of the period. In these works, we study Victorian interest in the relation between the self and society as it emerges through sympathy, memory, emotion, reverie, obsession, hysteria, monomania, insanity, and double consciousness. We will also evaluate how well more recent psychological concepts like trauma can elucidate Victorian texts. Readings may include Charlotte Brontë, Villette; Robert Browning, selected poems; Wilkie Collins, The Woman in White; Mary Elizabeth Braddon, Lady Audley's Secret; George Eliot, Daniel Deronda; Elizabeth Gaskell, Mary Barton; Robert Louis Stevenson, Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde; Tennyson, Maud"
ENGL 4521,"Gender, Memory, and History in Twentieth Century Fiction",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"AMST 4521, FGSS 4521",(LA-AS),,,"This seminar will investigate the narrative uses of history and memory in US fiction, focusing particularly on the impact of gender on these representations. How do US writers use history in their fiction, and to what ends? What are the effects on drawing on received historical narratives and what are the effects of constructing one's own history to fill a void in the received historical narrative? What's the difference between history and fiction, anyway? We will start from such questions in order to explore the extent to which history—personal or public—is produced by memory and reshaped by fiction. Authors under consideration may include: Julia Alvarez, Alison Bechdel, Pat Barker, Joy Kogawa, Toni Morrison, Monique Truong, and August Wilson"
ENGL 4535,The Modern Imagination: The Major Authors,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ENGL 6530,(LA-AS),,,"I imagine the Modern Imagination: The Major Authors as an indispensable, probing, and pleasurable course for those studying  nineteenth, twentieth and contemporary century literature as well as for MFAs, who are most welcome. We shall read major works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Yeats, and T.S.Eliot as well as works by Proust, Kafka, and Mann. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts, but we shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. We shall also be aware of critical and theoretical approaches. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism and relate literary modernism to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture"
ENGL 4600,Melville,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,AMST 4600,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Herman Melville is one of America's most trenchant social, political, and economic critics. Our study of Melville's fiction will analyze his critique of central national and international issues the effects of which are still with us. These issues are focused in the capitalist/imperialist matrix of settler colonialism with its machinery of slavery, Native American genocide,  patriarchy, and poverty"
ENGL 4665,Indigenous Fantasy and Futurisms,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(CA-AS),,,"Radically subverting the ""Vanishing Indian"" myth, Indigenous authors depict Indigenous peoples thriving in many possible futures. Although Indigenous speculative fiction is nothing new, we're currently seeing a new flush of Indigenous fantasy and futurism that combines Native conceptions of the universe and non-linear space-time with Indigenous and western technologies. Through revising generic conventions, Native authors overturn the closure of western conquest narratives while drawing on ancient beliefs and practices to ensure balanced, inter-relational survival—not only of human beings, but other-than-human persons, too. We will examine how these texts, hypertexts, films, games, and multimedia projects disavow the long-established sci-fi and fantasy tropes that place Indigenous peoples in the role of the ""alien"" that invades domestic space, or, conversely, the ""alien"" objects of ""discovery"" and invasion"
ENGL 4810,Advanced Verse Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course is intended for creative writers who have completed ENGL 3840 or ENGL 3850 and wish to refine their poetry writing.

ENGL 4903,Science Fiction and the Value of Utopia/Dystopia,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,"ASRC 4513, COML 4513",,,,"A pronounced turn away from utopian discourses has long been felt across multiple academic registers—aspects of queer theory rejecting futurity, portions of the radical left adopting a similar politics of no future, and scholars in African-American studies debating the idea of an Afro-pessimism, to name just a few examples. This accumulation of tragic thought brings the question: Does the utopian text no longer hold any value in the development of alternative political thought? This course, grounded in science fiction, will address this question via the thoughtful examination of a range of theoretical, fictional, and cinematic texts. Works to be studied throughout the semester will come from, among others, Frederick Jameson, Carlos Fuentes, Aldous Huxley, Alfonso Cuarón, Colson Whitehead, and Samuel Delany"
ENGL 4908,Victorian Masculinities,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"FGSS 4608, SHUM 4608",,,,"This course will focus on Victorian genders with a special emphasis on masculinities. Additionally, we will spend time reading and thinking about secondary works which interrogate and historicize our principal terms.  By the end of the course, you will have read a substantial amount of important secondary work regarding mid-century masculinities, as well as a good selection of both canonical and less-known Victorian works.  The course will focus on novels  and secondary readings about gender and especially masculinity. Most of these readings will be critical and historical, rather than theoretical in the strict sense. Although the course will focus on the construction of masculinity in the period, that topic cannot be discussed without reference to female identity, class, and sexuality, among other issues"

ENGL 6120,Beowulf,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,"one semester's study of Old English, or the equivalent, is recommended",,"ENGL 3120, MEDVL 3120, MEDVL 6120",,,,"In recent years, Beowulf has received renewed attention in popular culture, thanks to the production of two recent Beowulf movies and riveting new translations (eg. Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"

ENGL 6290,Milton,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course will cover Milton's major poetry and prose, paying special attention to the forms of authority—poetic, political, and theological—that are constituted within and by these writings. From his polemical prose in defense of regicide to his poetic rewritings of scripture, Milton cleaves to a dual set of imperatives to resist illegitimate rule and to obey proper authority. Though these impulses may seem incompatible, Milton takes pains to differentiate between unsanctioned rebellion and justified dissent, between service and servility, and between action and activity. We will explore the crucial distinctions that underwrite Milton's articulation of proper authority, while also taking account of the political and religious circumstances that informed them. And we will also look carefully at the poetic and rhetorical devices that allow Milton to distinguish paradox from contradiction"
ENGL 6320,"Literary Animal Studies: Species, Innovation and the Rise of the Animal in 18th Century Literature",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This course explores a set of novel representations of nonhuman beings in eighteenth-century English literature, defining and tracking the relationship between animals and formal innovation in this period, and projecting that innovation into the nineteenth century.  The course will engage and juxtapose various critical concepts that distinguish literary animal studies from the political critique of speciesism, and that include ecocriticism, ""thing theory"" and the new materialism, theories of radical interspecies politics and communication, and various reconceptualizations of alterity and the ""other."" Texts include canonical prose works (Jonathan Swift, Gulliver's Travels; Mary Shelley, Frankenstein), late-century poetry (Christopher Smart, Ann Yearsley), materials from the periodical press (Spectator Papers), and selections from popular nonhuman subgenres (it-narrative, lapdog epitaphs)"

Emphasizing French Psycho-Philosophical approaches to cinematic technologies, the course will rehearse the intellectual backdrop for understanding this Aesthetics of Excess with readings in Freud, Bergson, Artaud, Heidegger, and Merleau-Ponty in order to frame discussion of later twentieth and twenty-first century reflections on the balance between aesthetics and cinematic and new media technologies. In dialogue with a range of films and digital artworks, we will analyze texts to be chosen from Fanon, Barthes, Simondon,Lyotard, Deleuze, Derrrida, Kristeva, Laplanche, Stiegler, Duguet, Bellour, Nancy, and Rancière"

ENGL 6565,Decolonial Poetics and Aesthetics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,LSP 6565,,,,"Exploring a genealogy of Chicana/o, Latina/o, and Indigena/o theorizations of self and collective identity, the course asks, what is the decolonial? Is it a space between the colonial and post-colonial? Is it a process, theorization, or a period? Is it a performance, intervention, or embodied experience? Positing a genealogy and trajectory through poetry, performance, installation, and visual art, the course examines decolonial modes of production in the twentieth century with attention to antecedents and twenty-first contemporary applications. By centering our study on the question of what is decolonial, we will consider several lenses and frameworks, including the textual, oral, and visual. Authors include Gloria Anzaldúa, Chela Sandoval, Luis Alfaro, Emma Pérez, José Saldívar, Rupert García, Juan Felipe Herrera, James Luna, Coco Fusco, as well as scholars concerned with the primary documents of twentieth century activism"

ENGL 6732,The Global South Novel and World Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"The driving dialectic in post-colonial studies has been the colonizer/colonized, or the Third World vs. the West. But slowly the field is letting go of this ""arrested dialectic"" and in its place various triangulations are emerging: e.g. transnationalism, world literature, the global novel, and global south literary studies. Starting with a walk through the emerging theoretical concepts of world/global/transnational literature, we will primarily focus on a global south reading of African literature (itself a contested term), and perennial questions around language and translation. Specifically we will look at how writers such as Sol T Plaatje, V.S. Naipul, NoViolet Bulawayo, MG Vassanji, and Aminatta Forna challenge the post-colonial discourse and how a global south reading provides a uncomfortable conversation with transnational and world literature theories and concepts"
ENGL 6745,Black Diaspora Meets Black Queer Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This seminar will introduce graduate students to the cutting edge scholarship situated in the crossroads of black diaspora theory and black queer theory. Glissant's Poetics of Relation will be our starting point.

Do men and women solve spatial puzzles differently, as measured physiologically? Do nonhuman animals display sex-specific behaviors mediated by brain structure, and can we extrapolate these findings to human behavior? Why are boys three times more likely than girls to be diagnosed as autistic, and is there any connection between the predominantly male phenomenon of autism and other stereotypically male mental traits?

FGSS 4000,"Senior Seminar in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies",4,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"In this seminar, we will focus on the intersection of gender, sexuality, and human rights. Although issues of gender and sexuality have always been integral to human rights, in the last 40 years, they have become an increasingly articulated component of human rights activism, law, and policy making. This gendering of the international human rights agenda has run parallel to the growing institutionalization of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies in the academy. We explore this convergence between human rights theory and its practice in order to think about how feminist scholarship both emerges from and informs everyday lives around the world, especially those of women and sexual minorities. Within this rather broad rubric, we will consider various case studies and use these as examples for student research papers; these case studies will focus on central figures in human rights discourse—children, sex workers, garment workers, migrant agricultural labor, and transnational athletes. Throughout the semester, we will also consider how this course and others in FGSS prepare one to pursue jobs in human rights organizations and other advocacy fields.  This senior seminar is only open to, and is required by, Feminist, Gender, & Sexuality Studies majors"

This course will examine how intersectional disability experiences, in particular, impact and are impacted by access to employment, education, and health care. We will explore the efficacy of legal and policy initiatives that are already in place, and in doing so, strongly consider the growing need for, and value of, intersectional approaches to disability discrimination"

The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage"

How do US writers use history in their fiction, and to what ends? What are the effects on drawing on received historical narratives and what are the effects of constructing one's own history to fill a void in the received historical narrative? What's the difference between history and fiction, anyway? We will start from such questions in order to explore the extent to which history—personal or public—is produced by memory and reshaped by fiction. Authors under consideration may include: Julia Alvarez, Alison Bechdel, Pat Barker, Joy Kogawa, Toni Morrison, Monique Truong, and August Wilson"

Additionally, we will spend time reading and thinking about secondary works which interrogate and historicize our principal terms.  By the end of the course, you will have read a substantial amount of important secondary work regarding mid-century masculinities, as well as a good selection of both canonical and less-known Victorian works.  The course will focus on novels  and secondary readings about gender and especially masculinity. Most of these readings will be critical and historical, rather than theoretical in the strict sense.

Our focus of inquiry will be on themes that involve and relate to women, both directly and indirectly. We will particularly examine how and why women's status differs from one Middle Eastern country or region to another. From both theoretical and topical points of view, we will consider some of the most recent literature about women and gender. Since this is a history course, we will also examine how women's roles, as well as gendered systems and institutions, have changed over time"

It covers the main topics and questions regarding bodies, diseases, and medical institutions within the framework of major historical developments in world and region's history. The course investigates how medicine and knowledge about diseases and bodies changed political and social conditions as well as how the latter defined and transformed the ways in which people imagined health, life, and environment. Scholars have often analyzed history of medicine in the Middle Eastern societies either in relation to Islamic culture in the early modern period or in relation to more recent Westernization. This course seeks to challenge these fixed paradigms and shed light onto questions and research agendas that will unearth the encounters, connections and mobility of bacteria, bodies, and medical methods among various communities by locating the history of medical knowledge and practices of the Middle East within global history.  It will highlight that the history of medicine in the colonial world itself is varied and wide ranging, investigating how medical missions intersected with civilizing missions, how colonial discourses were used to explain disease prevalence, and the relationship between the metropole and colony in propagating certain medical theories and practices. The course seeks to facilitate student engagement with various primary and secondary sources and new technologies to teach both historiographical methods and the content of the history of medicine in the Middle East"

Performances of the everyday, alongside films, texts, and performance art, will be analyzed through a performance studies methodological lens.  Through close readings and sustained cultural analysis, students will acquire a critical understanding of the potentiality of spaces, places, and geographies codified as ""after hours"" in the development of subcultures, alternative sexualities, and emerging performance practices"

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"

They also create communities of fans – fanatics –with values and rituals that closely resemble religious movements. The guiding principle behind this writing seminar is that there is a relationship between the form of a particular sport – what happens on the field – and the fans it produces. The difference, then, between a Yankees and a Cowboys fan is not just a jersey, but a worldview. Students will practice academic writing skills by analyzing these worldviews as expressed in the books and films surrounding specific sports themselves. These will include Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch, Phil Alden Robinson's Field of Dreams, and Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, as well as critical works by Immanuel Kant, Susan Sonntag, and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht"

While acknowledging the social, economic, and political aspects of his thought, we will focus on its philosophical underpinnings, methodology, and implications.

Focusing on Franz Kafka's novels and tales, we will examine topics such as: the relationship between body and pain; society and the individual; authority and hierarchy; fathers and sons; writing and living; language and home; music and politics; and religion and persecution. Placing Kafka first within the socio-cultural context of Jewish-German-Czech Prague (and discussing problems of multicultural-lingual identity), we shall follow his literary journey to his vision of America (one of his novels). At the center of our discussions will be the effect of his work on literature, film, and theatre. We shall also discuss the effects of his work on contemporary theories of psychoanalysis, law, performance, modernism, architecture, and literature. Texts include novels and novellas: the Trial, the Castle, America, the Penal Colony, Metamorphoses, the Judgment, the Country Doctor, The Burrow, Josephine the Singer, or the Mouse Folk.

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively. We also consider how these three writers have been fused into a single constellation, 'Marx-Nietzsche-Freud,' and how they have been interpreted by others, including L. Althusser, A. Badiou, A.

Taking its cue from the ""digital turn,"" this course rephrases a traditional question asked in film theory about the nature of the medium (What is film?) in terms of a historical question: What was film when it was still something to be cut, wound up, and carried around, a thing with a literally explosive potential? Reframing the object of study in this manner will help situate familiar narrative cinema within more unfamiliar scientific, aesthetic, and experimental contexts. Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929)"

How did philosophers, pastors, and poets describe, observe, imagine sound before sounds could be recorded? Were there particular modes of listening or speaking more appropriate for the ""right"" kind of literary or philosophical understanding? How did listening intersect with the visual apprehension of the printed page, painting or sculpture? How do vocal techniques construct either a national culture or other types of communities? Readings will include texts by Plato, Lucretius, Augustine, Rousseau, Goethe, Klopstock, Herder, Nietzsche, Michel de Certeau, Friedrich Kittler, Michel Chion, and Walter Ong"

In this course, we will investigate the emergence of writing a self out of practices such as ascetic (in the Foucauldian sense) self-exploration and confession and the risks of introspection under conditions of secularization. We will explore theories of the autobiographical but also ask what kind of artistic practices and theoretical fields have emerged from genres like autobiography or diary (projects like cartographies in Perec or Ernaux; notions like aesthetics or ethics of everyday life). What stabilizing or destabilizing functions does writing the self serve? Is the ‚I' merely framed by narrative conventions, space and time (Blanchot), or can it find ways to mediate self and world, individual and society in writing?"

How do images produce meaning? How has vision been defined historically and methodologically? How has visual culture been construed theoretically? Our goal will be to sketch the genealogical trajectories that comprise visual studies as a field of investigation by focusing on concerns that have shaped larger theoretical debates on the politics and ethics of representation, including mimesis, realism, perspective, the interplay of word and image, attention, spectacle, and surveillance. Readings will be drawn from influential works in visual theory, cultural semiotics and anthropology, media studies, and the science of vision. They may include texts by Alpers, Bal, Barthes, Crary, Elkins, Foucault, Haraway, Jay, Livingstone, Merleau-Ponty, Mitchell, Stafford, Panofski, Ranciere, and Virilio, among others"

GOVT 1313,Introduction to Comparative Government and Politics,4,Stdnt Opt,"Spring, summer",,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course will introduce students to comparative politics—the study of the political institutions, identities, and organized interests in countries around the world. Emphasis is on how to make meaningful comparisons between systems in different countries. Towards that goal, we will be looking at a dozen countries with different histories, political systems, and from various regions around the world.  We will also use a comparative framework to use our knowledge of these (and other) countries to examine questions about democracies and democratization, electoral systems and political parties, authoritarian regimes, political mobilization and change, economic development and globalization, nationalism and identity politics, among other topics.  The meta theme of this course is the comparative method as a unique way of leveraging our understanding about social and political phenomena"

Has America entered a post-racial society in which racism and inequality are things of the past? Or does Obama's post-Black, race-neutral approach to governing signal the end of Black politics, race-based activism and prescriptive policy? In this course, students will use the Obama presidency to think, talk, and write about how race works in America. We'll examine the symbolism of Obama's personal narrative and biracialism to analyze his race-neutral campaigns and governing within the context of history, politics, and policies. We'll look at the public image of Michelle Obama, especially how she is gendered as Black radical and fashionista"

GOVT 3002,Civil Rights and Civil Liberties,4,Graded,Spring,,,AMST 3002,(SBA-AS),,,"This course presents an overview of the law regarding civil rights and civil liberties. But the law is only part of our focus. Rights do not spring into existence simply because a judge pounded a gavel or a president signed a bill. The rights and liberties we take for granted have been the subject of violent and bitter contests that go to the very meaning of national identity. To study the law of civil rights and civil liberties in this country is to study not just a collection of cases and statutes, but a history of endless struggle and eternally unfulfilled promise about what it means to be an American. Like GOVT 3001, this class places the development of civil rights and civil liberties in historic, political, and economic context"

Yet thousands of mis-marked butterfly ballots alone imply that a plurality of Florida's population did not prefer Bush. In this class we ask, what is a 'fair' electoral system in terms of representing the preferences of the public? In what ways can actual vote tallies and election outcomes deviate as measurements of these preferences? To address the latter question, we consider the emerging social science of election forensics and its application to recent disputed elections in Russia, Iran, Mexico, and Turkey, among other high-profile cases"

We will read, think, talk and write about the incarceration experience and about policies that shape this experience. We will also think self-reflexively about the character of the 'outsider's' educational, political, and personal engagement.   What are the motivations and what are the goals of such engagement? What are the anticipated outcomes - personal, social, educational, political, and/or moral and perhaps spiritual? In an effort to delve deeply into these questions, we will read a broad selection of work on incarceration, itself, as well as on the experience of what has come to be termed service learning or civic engagement"

They have a profound influence on American society, especially on our political community.  They amplify inequality and disadvantage. The massive number of people imprisoned in the United States speaks volumes about our policy priorities and about our democracy. How did things get this way? How did we end up being the nation that incarcerates more of its population than virtually any other? What policy processes directly and indirectly account for this? What explains the change that we now appear to be experiencing? What is the future of the U.S. prison system? What is the future of our democracy? This course will tackle these and other pressing questions. Students will gain an empirically grounded and theoretically far-reaching understanding of one of the most fundamental and transformative institutions in America"

The question is being asked today in relation to the political chaos that ensued and the rise in today's Libya of political movements and forces favorable or connected to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. This course is not intended to settle that question as is currently formulated. Instead, the course approaches the question of intervention in Libya in terms of the connections between global governance, the responsibility to protect, and political order and democracy in the zones of intervention. In this context, the course has two aims. The first is to contrast the approach of the African Union to the resolution of the Libyan crisis, which was summarily dismissed by the US and its allies, with the preferred approach of the Permanent Western members of the UN Security Council.  The second aim is to examine the manner in which the responsibility to protect was executed in Libya and the lessons that might be gained from it. "
GOVT 3333,Is China Recolonizing Africa?,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 3330,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"One key question about China's rise as an economic power has been what it does or is doing around the world. In this regard, China observers have taken note of emergence as the largest investors of late on the African continent. Also of significance is the fact that Chinese investments in Africa has been primarily in natural resources. This course is not about the benefits the concentration of investments in natural resources. Rather, it is about the manners in which China has defined its interests in Africa, pursued those interests, and the consequences that China's behavior for global governance, the domestic politics of African states, and the future well-being of African populations. Put into questions, the aims of this course are as follow: Should anyone should anyone worry about China's presence in Africa? Is China's presence part of the recolonizing of the Continent? Alternatively, is China's foray part of a global struggle for positioning between an emergent China and Africa's so-called traditional allies in the West? "

More specifically, how does a politics of vulnerability help us address the worldwide refugee crisis? How does it limit or preclude an understanding of certain conditions? How might the notion of precarity / precarious lives supplement vulnerability? We will use the growing body of feminist scholarship on vulnerability in law, philosophy, migration studies, and other fields to analyze the refugee crisis in particular locations, including Central American refugees being detained in the U.S. and Syrian refugees fleeing to Europe.

We derive the Ordinary Least Squares estimator and its characteristics using matrix algebra and determine the conditions under which it achieves statistical optimality. We then consider the circumstances in social scientific contexts which commonly lead to assumption violations, and the detection and implications of these problems. This leads to modified regression estimators that can offer limited forms of robustness in some of these cases. Finally, we briefly introduce likelihood-based techniques that incorporate assumptions about the distribution of the response variable, focusing on logistic regression for binary dependent variables. Students are expected to produce a research paper built around a quantitative analysis that is suitable for presentation at a professional conference.

The name of Ethiopia's last emperor before he assumed the throne, Ras Tafari, helped launch a new religion – Rastafarism.  This course juxtaposes Ethiopian history against the myths and legends that shaped Ethiopia and gave rise to Ethiopianism, a complex array of cultural, religious, and political movements in other parts of Africa as well as the African diaspora"

We will examine the ways in which Daoism was used variously to contest or legitimate imperial political power, and how the procedures and ideologies of the imperial state in turn informed Daoist theory and practice.  Throughout, we will examine the ways in which standard modern western dichotomies, such as sacred/secular, spiritual/physical, and mind/body, break down when we try to apply them to the study of Daoism.  Course will focus on the period from the fourth century B.C.E. to the thirteenth century C.E. "

HIST 2465,Democracy and Modern China,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASIAN 2266,,(GB),,"Chinese political culture has long been characterized by authoritarianism, from the time of the old imperial order up until the present Communist era. Yet the twentieth century in China witnessed a profound engagement with notions of democracy that was evident in the realms of both political discourse and political practice.

Environmental history is a quickly evolving field, taking on increasing importance as the environment itself becomes increasingly important in world affairs. During this semester, we'll examine the sometimes unexpected ways in which ""natural"" forces have shaped human history (the role of germs, for instance, in the colonization of North America); the ways in which human beings have shaped the natural world (through agriculture, urbanization, and industrialization, as well as the formation of things like wildlife preserves); and the ways in which cultural, scientific, political, and philosophical attitudes toward the environment have changed over time. This is designed as an intensely interdisciplinary course: we'll view history through the lenses of ecology, literature, art, film, law, anthropology, and geography. Our focus will be on the United States, but, just as environmental pollutants cross borders, so too will this class, especially toward the end, when we attempt to put U.S. environmental history into a geopolitical context.

Telegraph wires, steamships, and railways crossed oceans and continental frontiers, fundamentally changing how human beings understood their relationship to each other and to their world. This seminar will explore the period from a variety of vantage points. We will revisit sites on all continents and encounter a diverse cast of characters. Our goal will be to engage worldwide integration, not narrowly in economic terms, but as an array of profound social, political, cultural, and spatial transformations. How was space reordered and governed? What methods were used to mobilize labor? How did global connections shape inequality between and within societies, producing extraordinary prosperity alongside poverty, famine, and war? We will bring these questions to our conversations in a way that would both resonate with current events and enhance our understanding of particular national contexts"

While various systems of belief have been an integral part of state ideology or co-opted by the state to bolster its authority, they have also provided a potent basis for challenging the established order and fomenting rebellion. This course explores some of the major dimensions of this dynamic from ancient times up until the present day, with primary focus on the modern period. Considering such varied phenomena as imperial ritual sacrifice, the Taiping Rebellion, Tibetan Buddhism, and the current resurgence of religion under Communist rule, we will reflect on the dominant patterns and unique aspects of China's church-state model"

The institution was an important marker of adulthood, linking individuals and lineages in a network of mutual cooperation and support. Marriage practices and the concomitant gender expectations varied significantly between societies, and over time. As a result, marriage and divorce are especially rich terrain for exploring social history, women's agency, discursive constructions of 'women', masculinity and gender relations of power. This course explores some of the newest scholarship on marriage by Africanist scholars. The readings demonstrate the wide cultural variety in marriage as well as the dynamic relationship between marriage and historical change. They especially highlight women's roles and expectations in marriage, masculinity and the ways men and women negotiated the rules and boundaries of marriage"

Our focus of inquiry will be on themes that involve and relate to women, both directly and indirectly. We will particularly examine how and why women's status differs from one Middle Eastern country or region to another. From both theoretical and topical points of view, we will consider some of the most recent literature about women and gender. Since this is a history course, we will also examine how women's roles, as well as gendered systems and institutions, have changed over time"

HIST 4751,"Science, Race, and Colonialism",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,STS 4751,(HA-AS),,,"This course is divided into three major thematic sections. The first looks at the history of racial thinking in the West. We begin with the existence (or not) of conceptions of biological race in the early- modern period, focusing on early voyages of discovery and so-called ""first encounters"" between the peoples of the Old and New Worlds.  In the second part of the course we will look at early enunciations of racial thought in the late 18th century and at the problems of classification that these raised, before examining the roots of ""Scientific Racism."" We close with a look at Darwin, Social Darwinism, and eugenics movements in different national contexts.  The last third of the course looks at science and technology in colonial contexts, including ""colonial technologies"" (guns, steam- ships, and telegraphs) as well as medicine and public hygiene"
HIST 4922,Ocean: The Sea in Human History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASIAN 4492,(HA-AS),,,"This course focuses on the role of the oceans in human history, from earliest times to the present.  It does so by moving both chronologically and topically through oceanic history, so that a number of important topics are covered.  We start by looking at a number of different methodologies that may be useful in examining the sea, and then proceed to week-long reading sections on the sea in the ancient world, the Age of Discovery (European and non-European), and at the science of the sea.  The second half of the course gets more geographic in focus: week-long sessions deliberate on individual oceans and the main themes that have driven them, covering the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian Ocean and the polar seas.  Slavery, piracy, discovery, cultural transmission, nautics and science are a part of all of these stories, though in different ways.  The course hopes to impart to students the overwhelmingly important role of the oceans in forging human history, both in the centuries that have past and in our modern world.  Open to all students with an interest in the sea"
HIST 4967,The Collapse of the Soviet Union,4,Graded,,,,GOVT 4967,,,,"This course examines the main factors that caused the collapse of the Soviet superpower at the end of the Cold War by situating the events of 1985-1991 in the wider context of Soviet history and post-1991 developments. Situated at the intersection of history and political science, this class aims to provide both the theoretical tools and the factual knowledge necessary to lead an independent and critical reflection on the Soviet disintegration process. At the end of the semester students should be able to assess the multiclausal explanations of the Soviet collapse and critically question the narratives that both media and policy makers use to make sense of these events today. The class will also encourage reflections on the similarities and differences between the methodological approaches employed by historians and political scientists"

Some central questions include: What is the lived geography of the Caribbean at different moments, and how does using different geographic and temporal frameworks help approach the region's history? What role did people living in this amorphously demarcated region play in major historical transformations of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries? How did the varied, but interconnected processes of Caribbean emancipation impact economic and political systems throughout the Atlantic and beyond? The course will conclude with a mini conference in which students of both universities will come together to discuss the state of the field and future directions in Caribbean history"
HIST 6163,Cambodia/Cambodge: Colonial and Postcolonial Histories,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This seminar about modern Cambodia tackles the issues that dominate the political, socio-cultural, religious and historic landscape of Cambodia. The dominance of the Khmer Rouge and imagery of Angkor in historical explanations of Cambodia is ripe for reconsideration. New histories and anthropologies must grapple with these two intensely related moments in Cambodian history even as they attempt to move beyond them. In this course, students will help select readings that help critique the dominance of these tropes. We may begin the course with a review of Penny Edwards, Cambodge and recent studies of Cambodia within French Indochina. Other readings might include: Alexander Hinton, Man or Monster: The Trial of a Khmer Rouge Torturer, Anne Hansen, Learning to Behave, and others"
HIST 6181,Confluence: Environmental History and Science & Technology Studies,4,Graded,Spring,,,STS 6181,,,,"This course uses water to examine the confluence of two fields: environmental history and the social and historical studies of science and technology. Although preliminary scholarship has begun to demonstrate the fruitful integration of these fields, a number of methodological and theoretical tensions remain. Some of these tensions include the social construction of ""nature,"" nature as a historical actor, accounts of the emergence of ""environmental"" ""problems,"" constructivist models of science and technology, and scholars' use of technoscientific sources to assess environmental change. This class, therefore, examines a number of scholarly debates about key terms, definitions, and categories (both historical actors' and analysts'), knowledge-making about ""nature"" and human interactions with nonhuman nature, and the concept of agency. Weekly seminars are organized around readings in environmental history, science studies, and/or their intersection that explore these issues in diverse ways while usually addressing various aquatic environments in comparative historical and cultural perspective"

HIST 6350,The Writing of History,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,,,,"This graduate seminar approaches the writing of history as a problem rather than a given, as a craft or even an art rather than a standard method of presenting research. We'll consider as many kinds of history writing as possible, including some that are more traditional and some that are more experimental. To get at the complexity of the problem, we'll approach it from at least three distinct angles, examining the actual history of the writing of history (going back to Herodotus, ""The Father of Lies""); the theory and philosophy of the writing of history; and current writing practices. Readings will range widely through time and space and will be assessed not just for the quality of their arguments or their place in a given historiography but also for their success as pieces of writing. We'll discuss such topics as narrative structure, the role of the first person, tone, character development, and the basic use of language. Students will also be expected to do a fair amount of writing for this class and to share their papers in a workshop setting-though no new research will be required during the semester.

This suggests that much work remains to be done in organizations. The purpose of this course is to introduce you to current theory, research, and practice regarding discrimination and inclusion in the workplace.  We will begin by defining diversity and the multiple existing justifications for ""managing diversity"" within organizations. We will then examine bias within organizations, including its root cause in stereotyping and power differentials, and its manifestation in the implementation of HR practices, the treatment of employees, and in broader society. We will also explore the impact of demographic diversity on the functioning of work groups/teams, particularly as it relates to commonly made arguments about the ""business case"" for diversity.  We will spend some time discussing the role of HR and diversity practices in fostering inclusion, and the important role of an organization's climate and culture.

A major component of this legislation has to do with reasonable accommodations, yet there continues to be insufficient understanding of what constitutes a reasonable accommodation and the likely costs associated with providing these accommodations, both of which we will cover in the third week of the course. We will then move into a discussion of human resource management topics related to the hiring, career development, and performance management of people with disabilities. We will spend the last week situating all of this within a broader discussion of diversity management in organizations, as people with disabilities have not consistently been included in the diversity agenda of organizations"

Our class explores the third and second millennium Canaanite roots of the Phoenicians, as well as the Biblical and Greco-Roman perceptions of their early first millennium heyday. We will explore the Phoenician homeland and its colonies, and investigate their maritime economy, language, and religion through both archaeological and textual sources.

Why might it be justified for a lawyer to defend a client she knows to be guilty? Is it an excuse that one was ""just following orders""? We will investigate such questions by reading relevant legal opinions, as well as work by legal academics and moral philosophers.

Seamus Heaney). The poem's appeal lies in the complex depictions of its monsters, accounts of heroic bravery, and lavish portrayals of life in the Meadhall. Through close readings we will also explore the ""dark side"" of the poem: its punishing depictions of loss and exile, despairing meditations on unstable kingship and dynastic failure, and harrowing depictions of heroic defeat and the vanities of existence on the Middle-Earth. Attention to the poem's literary heritage (in Latin and Norse) and its layered pagan and Christian perspectives reveals an amalgamated Christian heroic ethos. [Readings in Old or Modern English]"

NBA 5140,Ethics and Corporate Culture,1.5,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"In the high-pressure worlds of business and law, all too often good people do bad things.  In many cases, the unethical behavior is due in part to a toxic corporate culture. The attitudes, values, and practices that prevail in their organizations induce otherwise ethical employees to take actions that violate widely shared norms of conduct. Such behavior can be costly-even disastrous-leading to ruined careers, tarnished corporate reputations, and legal liability for the individuals and their companies. In an environment where ""only results matter,"" it can be difficult for a new MBA or law school graduate to recognize the risks. If she does see the dangers, she may still find it hard to avoid them.  This course seeks to help MBAs and law students understand how a firm's culture, combined with common human tendencies, can tempt-or push-employees into unethical behavior.

NBA 5200,Retail Operations,1.5,GradeNoAud,Fall,,,,,,,"This course is designed as a half-semester elective course for MBA students. It will examine various new developments in retailing and the application of operations management principles to these developments. It is recommended for students interested in careers in (1) Retailing and supply chain management, (2) Businesses like banking, consulting, and information technology that provide services to retailers, and (3) Manufacturing companies that sell their products through retailers. Retailing is not only a link in the supply chain, but also an important industry for a number of reasons. This industry, more than any other, is at the forefront of business changes since it directly connects with the consumer and generates demand for the rest of the economy. It is an intensely dynamic industry, with continuous changes in marketing channels, technology, and sourcing. It has gone through remarkable developments through history, and has often been an incubator for new business concepts. Currently, retailing is leading economic growth and transformation in emerging markets around the world, both through global sourcing and global marketing. In the US, retailing comprises 40% of the economy, and is the largest employer. Problems faced by retailers are shared by other firms in the economy, and retailers are often the dominant player in a supply chain. Thus, retailing is also academically interesting as a laboratory to learn and test concepts that may apply to other businesses. Various types of sophisticated data can be collected in retailing easier than in other industries. Performance can be measured accurately and rapidly. Managers in retailing can also change their strategies and product mix in relatively short periods of time. Finally, low entry and exit barriers magnify risks and rewards in this industry, so that we find firms with stellar growth as well those with a history of bankruptcies. We shall study all these different aspects of retail operations through case discussions and lectures"

NBA 5770,Entrepreneurship in Creative Industries,1.5,S/U NoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"The venture capitalist Arthur Rock once said, ""I prefer to invest in companies that change the way we live and think."" This course is focused on strategies for creating and growing such companies: entrepreneurial leaders in the creative industries. Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success. These firms thus capture economic value by transforming cultural norms in ways that appear to, and sometimes do, change the way we think and live. This course will analyze business cases of such market-pioneers in a wide range of creative industries such as art, fashion, film, food, music, publishing, and theater to explore and understand the economic, organizational, and sociological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, value(s), markets, and culture. The course is targeted towards students who wish to understand the structure of creative industries and be inspired to start, work or consult for, or invest in large and small creative, high-impact firms. The course may also interest students seeking to understand how firms offering radical innovations can create new markets by addressing the entire market ecosystem"

Is your category lifecycle slow-and-long or fast-and-short? How to test a concept? How can you optimize the attributes of your new concept? How can you forecast the sales of the new product?), PRICING & ADVERTISING (Will a higher price help or hurt your brand? Does share-of-voice predict market share?).

They help you improve performance quickly and effectively, but one careless moment can cause irreparable damage and serious injury. This course encourages both deep skepticism about performance measures and pragmatic recognition of how useful they can be. Thoughtless adherence to performance measures leads many to decry ""bean counters,"" and emphasize that ""Not everything that counts can be counted, and not everything that can be counted counts."" Yet something gets counted whenever we need to make critical decisions throughout the workplace, politics and daily life. This course will help students interpret the performance measures generated by the managerial reporting systems most pervasive in modern organizations, design systems that generate more useful measures, and make better use those measures — even when what gets counted is but a misleading shadow of what counts"

NBAY 5770,Entrepreneurship in Creative Industries,1,GradeNoAud,Spring,,,,,,,"The venture capitalist Arthur Rock once said, ""I prefer to invest in companies that change the way we live and think."" This course is focused on strategies for creating and growing such companies: entrepreneurial leaders in the creative industries. Firms in creative industries, play a role in every aspect of our lives, and influence many physical and psychological aspects of our lives, from what we eat and wear to how we entertain ourselves, but markets for cultural goods are complex and difficult to navigate. Entrepreneurs must, therefore, understand the economic sociology of the cultural market and ecosystem in order to capture economic value, a process that recursively relates to cultural norms. At the same time, the creative industries are seen by some as the last frontier for technological innovations, where many of the gains made in other sectors by pioneering entrepreneurial leaders, have not yet been realized. This course will examine why this is the case by shedding light on the underlying economic, social, and cultural rules and norms that govern the structure and functioning of these markets, in order to derive strategies and business models for entrepreneurial success. These firms thus capture economic value by transforming cultural norms in ways that appear to, and sometimes do, change the way we think and live. This course will analyze business cases of such market-pioneers in a wide range of creative industries such as art, fashion, film, food, music, publishing, and theater to explore and understand the economic, organizational, and sociological underpinnings of entrepreneurship, value(s), markets, and culture"

The question is being asked today in relation to the political chaos that ensued and the rise in today's Libya of political movements and forces favorable or connected to Al-Qaeda and ISIS. This course is not intended to settle that question as is currently formulated. Instead, the course approaches the question of intervention in Libya in terms of the connections between global governance, the responsibility to protect, and political order and democracy in the zones of intervention. In this context, the course has two aims. The first is to contrast the approach of the African Union to the resolution of the Libyan crisis, which was summarily dismissed by the US and its allies, with the preferred approach of the Permanent Western members of the UN Security Council.  The second aim is to examine the manner in which the responsibility to protect was executed in Libya and the lessons that might be gained from it. "

The course explores major themes and periods in Iran's transition from the secular state of the Pahlavi dynasty to the religious state of the Islamic Republic in the 20th and 21st centuries. We will focus on social as well as political themes including the Anglo-Russo-American Occupation of Iran, the 1979 Islamic Revolution, U.S.-Iranian relations, Iraq-Iran War, the Green Movement and the crisis of Islamic government, Images of the West in Iran, Modern Youth Culture, Gender segregation, and the struggle between modernity and traditionalism in contemporary Iran. We will watch selected Iranian documentary and feature films and draw on modern Persian literature but will approach them not as art forms but as reflections of major socio-economic, political, and religious phenomena in Iran's modern history. We will read and watch what the Iranians wrote and produced, read and watched, in order to view and explain Iran and its relations with the West through the Iranian eyes. We will examine how the Iranians perceived themselves and the others, how they viewed their own governments and the West, what issues inspired and shaped their outlook outside the official censorship during the period in question. All readings are in English translation and the films are with English subtitles. The course includes lectures deconstructing political, religious, and social evolution of modern Iran as well as regular class discussions where we will address the issues in question from a variety of perspectives"

Common firm types include partnerships, sole proprietorships, non-profits, mutuals, and publicly traded corporations, among others. This course focuses on one important firm type: the modern publicly traded, privately owned corporation. The course uses economic and statistical analysis to study the interaction of the public corporation, the market, and the law, and how those interactions affect the welfare of managers, shareholders and consumers. The costs and benefits of that standard corporate form of organization are examined. A variety of legal institutions, some of which have evolved over decades, are analyzed. Those institutions define and govern the corporation. They include limited liability, fiduciary duties, the business judgment rule, and shareholder voting. The mechanisms of corporate governance, i.e., those legal and market-based forces that help control the corporation and ensure that managers operate it in shareholders' interest, are examined.

PHIL 1920,Introduction to Modern Political Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GOVT 1615,(HA-AS),(HB),,"This course offers a survey of modern political theory in the West.  We will examine some of the persistent dilemmas of political modernity and the attempts of several canonical political theorists to respond to them: Machiavelli, Hobbes, Locke, Rousseau, Burke, Mill, Marx, and Nietzsche.  In each case, we will attend to the particular crises these theorists addressed in their work—such as the European wars of religion, the English Civil War, colonialism, the French Revolution, and industrial capitalism—as well as the broader philosophical and political issues they continue to pose to us now.  Our approach will be both historical and conceptual, in other words, with the hopes of providing students with a nuanced but clear understanding of political theory as a distinctive form of political inquiry"
PHIL 2220,Modern Philosophy,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),(HB),,"A survey of Western philosophy in the 17th and 18th centuries: Descartes, Locke, Spinoza, Leibniz, Berkeley, Hume, and Kant. We focus largely on epistemology (ideas, skepticism, belief, knowledge, science) and metaphysics (bodies, minds, God, causation, natural laws, afterlife, personal identity). Some of the ethical implications of these systems will also be mentioned in passing"
PHIL 2240,Nineteenth and Twentieth Century European Thought,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GOVT 3745,(KCM-AS),,,"Survey of European social theory from Hegel to Foucault (via Marx, Nietzsche, Freud, Weber, and the Frankfurt School)"
PHIL 2310,Introduction to Deductive Logic,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(MQR-AS),,,"Covers sentential languages, the truth-functional connectives, and their logic; first-order languages, the quantifiers ""every"" and ""some,"" and their logic"
PHIL 2410,Ethics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"This course is intended to introduce and explore some of the big questions about the content, scope, and nature of morality. The first half of the course will focus on various first-order ethical theories, which offer criteria of morally right action. These will include consequentialist and deontological approaches, and also broadly virtue-theoretic approaches, which place more emphasis on the notion of moral character and/or are critical of focusing exclusively on what one ought to do as opposed to who one ought to be. The second half of the course will examine some of the more abstract questions about the nature of morality which are the province of twentieth-century metaethics. What is the nature of moral properties? Where in the world might they be located? Are they objective, subjective, and/or relative to particular times and places? What is the connection between morality, moral judgments, and being motivated to act morally? Interspersed with these theoretical ethical issues will be more concrete ethical questions about what to do as individuals in an often unjust social world"
PHIL 2455,Introduction to Bioethics,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,STS 2451,(KCM-AS),,,"Bioethics is the study of ethical problems brought about by advances in the medical field.  Questions we'll discuss may include:  Is it morally permissible to advance a patient's death, at his or her request, to reduce suffering?  Is there a moral dilemma between killing someone and letting someone die?  What ethical issues are raised by advance care planning?  How should the rights of pregnant women be balanced against those of the fetus?  What constitutes informed consent?  Should medical treatment ever be compulsory?  Should parents be given control over the genetic make-up of their children?  Are some forms of human enhancement morally troubling?  Should we aim to be better than well?  How should scarce health care resources or costly therapies be allocated to those in need?  Should organ sales be permitted?  Should doctors or hospitals be permitted to refuse to provide certain medical services that violate their consciences?"
PHIL 2460,Ethics and the Environment,4,Graded,Spring,,,"BSOC 2061, STS 2061",(KCM-AS),,,"Politicians, scientists, and citizens worldwide face many environmental issues today, but they are neither simple nor straightforward. Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"
PHIL 2621,Minds and Machines,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"Throughout history, metaphors drawn from technology of the time have been proposed to understand how the mind works. While Locke likened the newborn's mind to a blank slate, Freud compared the mind to hydraulic and electro-magnetic systems. More recently, many have endorsed Turing's proposal that the mind is a computer. Why is this idea attractive and what exactly is a computer? Is it at all plausible that the cells of your brain are computing? Could a computer ever really have a mind, beliefs, emotions and conscious experiences? What are these mysterious things anyway? Could a machine ever count as a person and make choices based on its own free will? Is it really so clear that we have this kind of free will?"
PHIL 2941,Ethics and Society: Aid and Its Consequences,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,ASRC 3333,(SBA-AS),(GB),,"The course looks at the connection between ethics and society.  It does so by focusing on the issues raised by the phenomenon of aid, giving or receiving it, and how we understand and react to it.  We seek to make sense of aid and its place In society.  We explore the ethics of aid from the point of view of philosophy.  We move to working through the implications of aid for (1) the giver; (2) the receiver; (3) the society, local and global; (4) the relations between individuals in a given society with respect to aid and; (5) relations between one society and its members and another society when they engage in aid-related activities"
PHIL 3252,Marx as Philosopher,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,GERST 3552,(KCM-AS),(HB),,"Marx is often read primarily as an economic and political theorist or even as a social activist. This course will instead cast him as, first and foremost, a philosopher. Beginning with Marx's early encounters with Hegel, we will survey his major published and unpublished works, culminating in volume 1 of Capital. While acknowledging the social, economic, and political aspects of his thought, we will focus on its philosophical underpinnings, methodology, and implications. Our principal themes will be Marx's so-called ""dialectical"" method of argumentation, materialist theory of history, philosophical anthropology, and theory of value. Supplementary readings may include texts by Hegel, Feuerbach, Bauer, Lukács, Althusser, Bloch, Hyppolite, Miller, Meikle, and Wood"

PMA 1104,FWS: The Case of the Female Detective,3,Graded,Spring,,,,,,,"""Women don't fit well into a trench coat and slouch hat,"" Marilyn Stasio has observed, yet female detectives can be found solving crimes and busting bad guys across media. Drawing from TV, film, fiction and theatre, this course explores the ways in which the female detective radically revises the conventions of the crime narrative in which she functions. Interrogating an inherent tension between gender and genre, we'll ask how different media construct female detectives and what gets re-visioned when Miss Marple and Clarice Starling fight violence and restore social order.

Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929)"

We will examine both practices themselves - techniques of meditation and contemplation - religious ways of using intellect, forms of chant and ritual, and the dynamics through which these have left a wider mark on South Asian civilization. These dynamics include not only the evident reverberations of practice in philosophical reflection and socioreligious institutions, but also wide-ranging processes of stylization, elaboration, and popularization found throughout South Asian culture. In order to get a sense of the experiences treated in classical religious texts, students will be expected to experiment with some basic meditation practices. At least as important for the work of the course (and much more important for the grade) will be the ways in which students situate these practices within larger South Asian world views as suggested by doctrines, rituals, iconic forms, and literary texts.

The flight of the gods and the death of God have supposedly left a disenchanted world with little room for the sacred. However, in this class we will study modern European writers, artists, and philosophers who rejected conventional religion but held fast to a concept of the divine or the holy. In particular, we will trace the desire for a ""new mythology"" and examine critically the transition from religious art to art as religion, in which the artistic genius is deified. Were these currents radical or reactionary? Are enchantment and enthusiasm compatible with atheism and materialism? What is the price of Enlightenment and what are the risks of resisting it? Helping us answer these questions will be authors like Blake, Hölderlin, Wackenroder, Baudelaire, Mallarmé, Yeats, George, Rilke, and Mann. We will also read philosophy by Nietzsche, Heidegger, Eliade, Blumenberg, Girard, and Derrida. In addition, we will experience Wagner's Parsifal and look at a wealth of visual art"

This course explores the unfolding of Buddhist life in contemporary South and Southeast Asia, in locations such as Burma, Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, and Cambodia. We will see how the practices of meditation and philosophical reflection enter the lives of Buddhists, along with other expressions of devotion, aesthetic fascination, political action, and sociability. Our goal will be to recognize the sensual, emotional, and social qualities of Buddhist practice, and the ways in which life unfolds in a Buddhist idiom"

By the end of the semester, students will be able to articulate some ways that Hasidism reflects both broader trends in European religious and moral thought of its time, and some ways that it represents distinctively Jewish developments. You will also gain a deeper appreciation of the various kinds of evidence and disciplinary approaches that need to be brought to bear on the attempt to articulate as broad, deep and varied a phenomenon as modern Hasidic Judaism. "

You would have noted how the answer shifts according to who is asking, in which context, etc. While everyone is unique, the possible replies in any one situation are largely defined at the level of society. What is less often realized, however, is that identity shows in particular in ways of doing: what and how one eats; what one wears and when; how one moves in a space. Archaeology is in a unique position to investigate these questions, and the Greek and Roman worlds offer a fruitful test ground, both because of their varied evidence, and because of their peculiar echoing in the modern world and its manifold identities.

While various systems of belief have been an integral part of state ideology or co-opted by the state to bolster its authority, they have also provided a potent basis for challenging the established order and fomenting rebellion. This course explores some of the major dimensions of this dynamic from ancient times up until the present day, with primary focus on the modern period. Considering such varied phenomena as imperial ritual sacrifice, the Taiping Rebellion, Tibetan Buddhism, and the current resurgence of religion under Communist rule, we will reflect on the dominant patterns and unique aspects of China's church-state model"

A fundamental premise of this course is that any study of Tibetan Buddhism must take into consideration the implications of the dramatic events which have shaped the last sixty years of Tibetan history, and the fracture of meaning caused by the near destruction of this religious world after the communist invasion and subsequent full occupation of Tibet.  Understanding how the lens of exile and a nostalgia for a pre-Chinese invasion history shape current studies of Tibetan Buddhism will be a continuing theme throughout this course.  At the end of this course, it is hoped that students will have a grounded and nuanced understanding of the complexities of this great religious tradition, the implications of its appropriations in the western imagination as an idyllic Shangri-la, and the challenges Tibetan Buddhism faces as a diverse religious tradition as it attempts to rebuild its religious institutions in exile"

Following a brief historical outline of the development of the academic study of religion, we will survey major approaches to the academic study of religion currently used and discussed in Religious Studies today. We will read representative and seminal works from the following approaches to the study of religion: anthropology, philosophical hermeneutics, phenomenology, history of religions, the sociology of religion and critical ideological studies. For each of these cases, we will see how these studies both build upon the nineteenth century assumptions of the nature of religion and have addressed twentieth century religious and theoretical issues. For each of the texts we will be reading, we will try to grasp why particular approaches had the appeal they did when they did. The course operates as an intellectual history of the rise of the study of religion as an academic (as opposed to confessional) subject"

This seminar will  engage these ideas across a wide range of disciplines and topics including: the specular/reflecting skin, mediatic skins, metabolism and megastructures, the digital skin, the new grotesque, and Big Data and networked skins.

How is an understanding of media in relation to elemental materiality transforming the ontological, ecological, intellectual, and political contours of media studies?

Considering questions of performance, censorship, embodiment, pleasure, and representational politics, we will evaluate how race, particularly Black skin, has been used as a signifier and complex code for various things on screen. In doing so, we will investigate how blackness is contingent on the specifics of its historical, social, and cultural production and, yet, open to multiple and competing claims. Therefore, blackness here is less a stable racial category than theoretical motor, operated by moving and contested discourses, histories, images, meanings, and performances by Black subjects. Focusing on Black skin representation and discourses of blackness as a cultural signifier, students will watch and discuss important representations and misrepresentations of blackness on screen"

Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"

Today more than ever, when science and technology have penetrated everyday life in ways that would have seemed impossible only a few decades ago, it has become apparent that science fiction is not merely a literary genre but a whole way of being, thinking, and acting in the modern world. The course explores classic and contemporary science fiction from Frankenstein to The Hunger Games alongside a rich array of fiction, films, and new media from Europe, Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Our discussions will position these works vis-à-vis seminal thinkers, ranging from Plato to Descartes and Donna Haraway to Paul Crutzen, who ask the same questions as science fiction does about ourselves, our world, and our future"

Interest in this ""medicalization of life"" may be one of the reasons that medical anthropology is currently the fastest-growing subfield in anthropology. This course encourages students to examine concepts of disease, suffering, health, and well-being in their immediate experience and beyond. In the process, students will gain a working knowledge of ecological, critical, phenomenological, and applied approaches used by medical anthropologists. We will investigate what is involved in becoming a doctor, the sociality of medicines, controversies over new medical technologies, and the politics of medical knowledge. The universality of biomedicine (or hospital medicine) will not be taken for granted, but rather we will examine the plurality generated by the various political, economic, social, and ethical demands under which biomedicine has developed in different places and at different times. In addition, biomedical healing and expertise will be viewed in relation to other kinds of healing and expertise. Our readings will address medicine in North America as well as other parts of the world. In class, our discussions will return regularly to consider the broad diversity of kinds of medicine throughout the world, as well as the specific historical and local contexts of biomedicine"

We will ask how medicine is connected to various sociocultural factors such as gender, social class, race, and administrative cultures. We will examine the rise of medical sociology as a discipline, the professionalization of medicine, and processes of medicalization and demedicalization. We will look at alternative medical practices and how they differ from and converge with the dominant medical paradigm. We will focus on the rise of medical technology in clinical practice with a special emphases on reproductive technologies. We will focus on the body as a site for medical knowledge, including the medicalization of sex differences, the effect of culture on nutrition, and eating disorders such as obesity and anorexia nervosa. We will also read various classic and contemporary texts that speak to the illness experience and the culture of surgeons, hospitals, and patients, and we will discuss various case studies in the social construction of physical and mental illness"
STS 3181,"Living in an Uncertain World: Science, Technology, and Risk",4,Graded,Spring,,,"BSOC 3181, HIST 3181",(HA-AS),,,"This course explores the history, sociology, and ethics of risk. In particular, we will focus on the complex and often ambiguous relationship between science, technology, and risk. A historical perspective shows how science and technology have generated risks while they have also played key roles in managing and solving those very risks. By examining several case studies, including 19th-century mining, the 1911 Triangle fire, nuclear science, the space shuttle disasters, asbestos litigation, Hurricane Katrina, and the contemporary financial crisis, we will consider how risk and ideas about risk have changed over time. By exploring different historical and cultural responses to risk, we will examine the sociopolitical dimensions of the definitions, perceptions, and management of risk both in the past and the present"
STS 3241,Environmental Sociology,3,Graded,Spring,,,"DSOC 3240, SOC 3240",(SBA-AS),,,"The course examines the relationships between human populations and the environment, with an emphasis on the importance of demographic change in shaping the natural environment. We will examine a variety of theoretical perspectives used in the analysis of population- environmental relationships, and will consider how a range of forces (technology, institutions, culture) might mediate these linkages. Focus on population will expand beyond traditional emphasis on population size to also consider the role that population composition and other population processes play in driving environmental change (including climate, land-use, water, energy resources), and how this change, in turn, impacts human populations. We will also raise some of the methodological challenges that arise when studying these linkages, and students will work with secondary data to conduct their own analyses on population-environment questions. By the end of the course, students should have the theoretical and methodological tools to better connect with public debates around issues of environmental justice, sustainability, conservation, and population policy"

Laptops, PDAs, webcams, cell phones, and iPods are not just devices, they also provide narratives, metaphors, and ways of seeing the world. This course critically examines how computing technology and society shape each other and how this plays out in our everyday lives. Identifies how computers, networks, and information technologies reproduce, reinforce, and rework existing cultural trends, norms, and values. Looks at the values embodied in the cultures of computing and considers alternative ways to imagine, build, and work with information technologies"

These problems include the regulation of novel technology, the role of technical expertise in public decision making, and the control over scientific research. The first part of the course covers basic perspectives in S&TS and how they relate to legal decisions and processes. The second part covers a series of examples and legal cases on the role of expert judgments in legal and legislative settings, intellectual property considerations in science and medicine, and legal and political oversight of scientific research. The final part examines social processes and practices in legal institutions, and relates these to specific cases of scientific and technological controversy. Lectures and assignments are designed to acquaint students with relevant ideas about the relationship between legal, political, and scientific institutions, and to encourage independent thought and research about specific problems covered in the course"

This course looks not only at animals in their social lives, but also at animals in their lives with us. We ask questions about how species become entangled and what that means for both parties, about the social lives of animals independently and with humans, about the survival of human and animal species, and about what it means to use animals for science, food, and profit. The course draws on readings from Anthropology, Science & Technology Studies, and animal trainers and behaviorists"

In this sense, the production of cosmologies is not only a scientific or theoretical enterprise, but also has direct implications for religion, politics, and social ideology. We will adopt a broad approach to the study of the dominant cosmological models in the medieval Mediterranean (ca. 500-1500 C.E.), considering both their sources (Greco-Roman science, mythology, revealed religion, etc.) and their expressions in literature, art, and music"

We live in a hazardous world of uncertainty, surrounded by claims about risks, some sounding the alarm, some seeking to reassure. Scientists, engineers, and managers try to measure and model the risks embedded in complex systems, hoping to improve our understanding and guide decisions. This seminar will consider risk from the perspective of the social sciences. How do individuals, organizations, and societies produce knowledge about hazards? How do they decide which threats deserve their attention? How do conflicting viewpoints about risk shape technology and politics? We will examine controversies in public health, disaster management, medicine, finance, emerging technologies, and the environment. The central theme of the course will be a social investigation of how natural and social sciences have approached the problem of risk"

Professors, doctors, countries, hotels, pollution, books, intelligence: there is hardly anything that is not subject to some form of review, rating, or ranking these days. This senior seminar examines the practices, cultures, and technologies of evaluation and asks how value is established, maintained, compared, subverted, resisted, and institutionalized in a range of different settings. Topics include user reviews, institutional audit, ranking and commensuration, algorithmic evaluation, tasting, gossip, and awards. Drawing on case studies from science, technology, culture, accounting, art, environment, and everyday life, we shall explore how evaluation comes to order our lives – and why it is so difficult to resist"

When architecture is understood as an organism, and the skin and structure of architecture as a system, the conflation of structure into the skin is a way of thinking of the architectural enclosure as a deep skin, and the individual parts of which an architectural skin is constructed, as a study of the tissue of structure. This seminar will  engage these ideas across a wide range of disciplines and topics including: the specular/reflecting skin, mediatic skins, metabolism and megastructures, the digital skin, the new grotesque, and Big Data and networked skins. The skin of architecture is the intersection of theory, materiality, affect, signification, and comfort"

This seminar develops a set of theoretical frameworks and methodologies for thinking about the ontologies, ecologies, and materialities of media with a particular focus on the relationship between media and the elemental world – the world of clouds, sediment, water, ecological systems, atmospheres, and bodies. How is an understanding of media in relation to elemental materiality transforming the ontological, ecological, intellectual, and political contours of media studies? To explore this topic, this seminar draws material from media studies and new materialism in conversation with perspectives in anthropology, science and technology studies, environmental studies, and art history, and philosophy"

STS 4751,"Science, Race, and Colonialism",4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,HIST 4751,(HA-AS),,,"This course is divided into three major thematic sections. The first looks at the history of racial thinking in the West. We begin with the existence (or not) of conceptions of biological race in the early- modern period, focusing on early voyages of discovery and so-called ""first encounters"" between the peoples of the Old and New Worlds.  In the second part of the course we will look at early enunciations of racial thought in the late 18th century and at the problems of classification that these raised, before examining the roots of ""Scientific Racism."" We close with a look at Darwin, Social Darwinism, and eugenics movements in different national contexts.  The last third of the course looks at science and technology in colonial contexts, including ""colonial technologies"" (guns, steam- ships, and telegraphs) as well as medicine and public hygiene"
STS 4821,What was Film?,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,"COML 4312, GERST 4312, PMA 4512",(CA-AS),,,"In retrospect, was film anything more than some highly flammable strips of celluloid? Taking its cue from the ""digital turn,"" this course rephrases a traditional question asked in film theory about the nature of the medium (What is film?) in terms of a historical question: What was film when it was still something to be cut, wound up, and carried around, a thing with a literally explosive potential? Reframing the object of study in this manner will help situate familiar narrative cinema within more unfamiliar scientific, aesthetic, and experimental contexts. Early film theorists saw great potential in the new medium, thought to be capable of conveying a new experience of movement and time, creating a new art of light and shadow, or functioning as a new kind of scientific instrument. Screenings will put readings of early film theory in dialogue with early European silent films that address similar concerns about the nature of cinema, such as A Trip to the Moon (1902), The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), The Adventures of Prince Achmed (1926), and Man with a Movie Camera (1929)"

After being introduced as a subfield of sociology in the 1960s, ethnomethodology became an interdisciplinary program with representation ins several social science fields, including Science & Technology Studies. This course begins with an examination of ethnomethodology's philosophical roots. It then examines some of the main theoretical and conceptual issues in ethnomethodology, before focusing on ethnomethodological studies of the natural science and mathematics, and other areas of technical work. The aim of the course is to acquaint students with a conceptual background and research strategies that continue to have value for developing insightful empirical studies of a broad range of social phenomena"
STS 6181,Confluence: Environmental History and Science & Technology Studies,4,Graded,Spring,,,HIST 6181,,,,"This course uses water to examine the confluence of two fields: environmental history and the social and historical studies of science and technology. Although preliminary scholarship has begun to demonstrate the fruitful integration of these fields, a number of methodological and theoretical tensions remain. Some of these tensions include the social construction of ""nature,"" nature as a historical actor, accounts of the emergence of ""environmental"" ""problems,"" constructivist models of science and technology, and scholars' use of technoscientific sources to assess environmental change. This class, therefore, examines a number of scholarly debates about key terms, definitions, and categories (both historical actors' and analysts'), knowledge-making about ""nature"" and human interactions with nonhuman nature, and the concept of agency. Weekly seminars are organized around readings in environmental history, science studies, and/or their intersection that explore these issues in diverse ways while usually addressing various aquatic environments in comparative historical and cultural perspective"
STS 6311,Qualitative Research Methods for Studying Science,4,Graded,Spring,,,SOC 6310,,,,"In this Graduate seminar we will discuss the nature, politics and basic assumptions underlying qualitative research. We will examine a selection of qualitative methods ranging from interviewing, oral history, ethnography, participant observation, archival research and visual methods. We will also discuss the relationship between theory and method. All stages of a research project will be discussed - choice of research topic and appropriate methods; human subject concerns and permissions; issues regarding doing research; as well as the process of writing up and publishing research findings"
STS 6321,Inside Technology,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,SOC 6320,,,,"Rather than analyze the social impact of technology upon society, this course investigates how society gets inside technology. In other words, is it possible that the very design of technologies embody assumptions about the nature of society? And, if so, are alternative technologies, which embody different assumptions about society, possible? Do engineers have implicit theories about society? Is technology gendered?
