AMST 3562,Thinking from a Different Place: Indigenous Philosophies,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AIIS 3560, ENGL 3560",(LA-AS),,,"Native and Western philosophies serve similar functions: they organize societies and construct those taken-for-granted truths we all operate from, but rarely examine. Even as such ""truths"" create ideas about how the world and universe work, these differences can be a source of conflict between people groups. In this class, we'll examine how Indigenous knowledge systems are formed and expressed, and what can be the result when people with conflicting knowledge systems interact with one another. Through readings, discussions, lectures, films, a guest presentation, group work, and other course assignments, we'll consider Indigenous North American knowledge systems and worldviews with a particular eye toward how these ideas are related to geographic space, social structure, culture, science, and contemporary global problems"
AMST 3690,The Race and Gender of Poverty in Literature and Film,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 3690, FGSS 3691",(CA-AS),,,"Poverty is an ongoing issue in the United States, and has intensified since the recession of 2008.

The course will have a lecture/discussion format; student participation is highly valued and encouraged. The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about ""progress"" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change"

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early ""hip hop feminism"" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, people of color in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

AMST 6440,Black Girlhood Ethnographies,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,"ANTHR 6444, ASRC 6440",,,,"This graduate seminar recognizes the current critical moment in Black girlhood studies as a pivotal point for addressing questions related to coming of age in the African diaspora, Black feminism, and the analytical power of ethnography. Black girls are hypervisible, both as ""at risk"" and as cultural trendsetters, and simultaneously rendered invisible in public policy discourses. Yet, Black girls' social worlds reveal entrenched racialized and gendered inequalities, and form the basis for some of the most innovative work in the social sciences and the humanities. We will consider Black girlhood studies that fall within the ethnographic tradition, including Elizabeth Chin's Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture (2001), Oneka LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox's Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship (2015), using these texts to examine Black girls' complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities. The course will also explore the transition from girlhood to womanhood, while surveying the borders of interdisciplinarity and what constitutes Black girlhood ethnography by considering historical approaches, films, and ethnographic novels. Other works covered will include Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), and Octavia Butler's Fledgling (2005).  While our primary focus will be on Black girlhood in the U.S. and the Caribbean, broader diasporic treatments such as Céline Sciamma's Girlhood/Bande de Filles (2014) will frame black girlhood in global contexts"
AMST 6606,The Politics of Pragmatism,4,Graded,Fall,,,GOVT 6606,,,,"This seminar will examine the political consequences of American pragmatism. Through a close study of the major works of William James and John Dewey we will explore pragmatist theories of inquiry, experience, faith and belief, agency, value, truth, power, and critique as resources for the study of politics. In addition to these canonical texts, we will consider historical and contemporary perspectives on pragmatism and politics from a range of thinkers, possibly including West, Rorty, Habermas, Bernstein, Bourdieu, Deleuze, Latour, Stengers, and Boltanski.   "
AMST 6645,Democratic Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,GOVT 6645,,,,"In contemporary political contexts ""democracy"" is often invoked as the very ground of political legitimacy. There is very little agreement, however, on what democracy means or how it is best embodied in state institutions and law. This seminar will introduce students to select debates in contemporary democratic theory over the normative meaning of democracy and the limitations of contemporary democratic practice. Beginning with the work of Rousseau and ending with debates over ""radical democracy,"" we will explore the following themes: How do democratic theorists and democratic actors negotiate the paradoxes of collective self-rule? What is the relationship between liberalism and democracy? Do rights suspend democracy or establish its preconditions? What are the best procedures for democratic decision-making? How does democracy deal with difference? Is democracy best understood as a form of government or a practice of resistance to domination?"

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early ""hip hop feminism"" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool?

Those trying to make sense of the cross-cultural terrain of Indian-State relations find that apparently straightforward political and legal concepts such as ""land,"" ""property,"" ""sovereignty,"" and ""identity"" often seem inadequate, based as they are on European cultural assumptions. These terms tend to take on new - and often ambiguous - meanings in the realm of Indian-State relations. In the first part of this course, we will explore some of these ambiguous meanings, paying attention to the cultural realities they reflect and the social relationships they help shape.

Black girls are hypervisible, both as ""at risk"" and as cultural trendsetters, and simultaneously rendered invisible in public policy discourses. Yet, Black girls' social worlds reveal entrenched racialized and gendered inequalities, and form the basis for some of the most innovative work in the social sciences and the humanities. We will consider Black girlhood studies that fall within the ethnographic tradition, including Elizabeth Chin's Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture (2001), Oneka LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox's Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship (2015), using these texts to examine Black girls' complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities. The course will also explore the transition from girlhood to womanhood, while surveying the borders of interdisciplinarity and what constitutes Black girlhood ethnography by considering historical approaches, films, and ethnographic novels. Other works covered will include Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), and Octavia Butler's Fledgling (2005).  While our primary focus will be on Black girlhood in the U.S. and the Caribbean, broader diasporic treatments such as Céline Sciamma's Girlhood/Bande de Filles (2014) will frame black girlhood in global contexts"

The purpose of this course will be to discover the layers of Rome, combining archaeology with literature, architecture, and urban history with art history. The goal is a thorough and direct knowledge of the Roman and Medieval urban landscape and the way this landscape has sometimes survived until today. Special attention will be given to Roman and Medieval building typology, both private and public, and the development of the urban infrastructure (street system, water supply, fortifications, etc.). Strong emphasis will be placed upon continuity, use/reuse, and transformation of buildings and spaces, etc. Every week one or two different ""regions"" will be explored that are typical for a particular moment of the urban history.

Central topics include imperialism, urbanism, economy, and social life. What was the archaeological imprint of conquest? How did goods travel around such a wide geographical expanse? What images did people in Britain have of the emperor? We will investigate particular types of evidence, from public monuments over ceramic amphorae to the road system.

As space has been transformed from a passive setting for action to a critical force in social process, landscape and place have emerged as unifying concepts for the interpretation of distinctly ""social"" spaces. This course will consider the primary contemporary approaches to landscape and place, considering theoretical writings and spatial case studies drawn from archaeology, ethnography, art history, architecture, and geography. We will also consider contemporary methods of spatial analysis, particularly GIS frameworks) and assess their impact on human communities.

ARTH 1156,FWS: Bibliophilia - A Visual History of Women Reading,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"Tranquil depictions of women reading books arguably constitute one of the loveliest recurring themes in the history of art. On one hand, they capture interior, intellectual lives, the quiet intimacy of the domestic sphere. On the other, they reveal the learned woman as radical, access to information as dangerous to the patriarchy, literacy as powerful and subversive, and reading as a means to connect, escape, and transcend. This course considers the rich trove of images of women reading, and seeks to complicate it by highlighting the various ways in which they reflect and confront history and culture through theories of privilege, access, pleasure, leisure, and labor. Works include paintings by Mary Cassatt and Diego Rivera, images of Marilyn Monroe and Virginia Woolf, and evocations of literary bibliophiles like Hermione Granger and Elena Ferrante.

Think about the heightened experience of living through the exceptional, consciously historical time that characterizes revolutionary moments. How is this sense of extraordinariness communicated by visual accounts of a historical event, or embedded in the articulations of its fantasies? How do the works of visual and material culture imagine and shape, or re-imagine and commemorate the revolution? Following these questions, ""Visions of Revolution"" covers case studies to investigate the relationship between 'revolutionary action' and art; and between art and 'revolutionary imagination'.  "

As a result, Roman archaeology allows us to explore questions that historians and archaeologists of other periods often cannot. Within this rich body of archaeological evidence, this course will focus on key themes and material for the Roman period in Italy and the Western provinces (especially Gaul and Britain). Central topics include imperialism, urbanism, economy, and social life. What was the archaeological imprint of conquest? How did goods travel around such a wide geographical expanse? What images did people in Britain have of the emperor? We will investigate particular types of evidence, from public monuments over ceramic amphorae to the road system. And we will explore methodological issues, such as what archaeological evidence can tell us, or how to introduce protagonists other than emperors and armies in our reconstructions of the Roman world. Throughout the course, we will question whether the modern world is a productive and valid parallel for archaeological study of the Roman world"

This seminar presents an introduction to the methods used by art historians and the objects and ideas that constitute the historiography of their discipline. If art history was once understood as the study of the development of style in ""European art,"" over the past century its practitioners have attempted to embrace a ""global"" perspective and to address issues of class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender. Readings will focus on historically situating methods and the implications of their cross-cultural application. Papers will encourage students to put methods into practice, realizing in the process that subject matter is not an isolated choice to which methods are applied, but something that profoundly affects the approach that the researcher brings to the writing of art history"

We will try especially to develop: (1) a general theory of ""visual ideology"" (the gender, social, racial, and class determinations on the production, consumption, and appropriation of visual artifacts under modern and postmodern conditions); and (2) contemporary theoretical practices that articulate these determinations. Examples will be drawn from the history of oil painting, architecture, city planning, photography, film, and other mass media"

Readings will focus on historically situating methods and the implications of their cross-cultural application. Papers will encourage students to put methods into practice, realizing in the process that subject matter is not an isolated choice to which methods are applied, but something that profoundly affects the approach that the researcher brings to the writing of art history"

We will explore ways different groups of Japanese people (intellectuals, bureaucrats, business people, religious figures, etc.) have imagined themselves as members of a collectivity or nation, and how these ways of framing identity have been picked up, celebrated, contested and projected back onto Japan by people outside of Japan. We are particularly interested in the following frames of Japaneseness:  1) Japan the divine nation; 2) Japan the aesthetic country; 3) Japan the warrior nation; 4) Japan the industrious economic miracle; and 5) Japan the vanishing and/or hypermodern.  For each section of the course, we will explore how a particular frame is presented as ""truth,"" how the frame gets produced,  consumed and understood, and some of the implications of the frame as a mode of cultural self-knowledge"

Taking Hindi film songs as a celebratory yet critical guide to South Asian history and culture, we will examine issues such as gender, nationalism, and globalization.

This course considers the history of Chinese communism from its origins in the aftermath of the First World War up to the present. In following the CCP along its road to revolution and through its decades in power, we chart the ways in which Chinese communism shaped and shifted the dynamics between state and society in China's tumultuous twentieth century. At the same time, we explore how Chinese communism as an ideological and institutional force influenced and was, in turn, influenced by various global currents and movements, from Cold War politics to radical agrarian insurgencies.

It will be divided into a number of inter-related modules. After a framing lecture, we will briefly cover the two countries' distinct experiences with colonialism and centralized planning. Then we will move on to dynamics of growth, which will seek to explain the relative success of China in the era of market reforms. In analyzing political consequences, we will assess how new forms of cooperation and conflict have emerged. This will involve attention to both internal dynamics as well as how rapid development has seen an increasing accumulation of political power in the East. It goes without saying that accelerating growth has led to huge social change, resulting in profound reorganizations of Chinese and Indian society.

Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining ""what China is"" via a consideration of transnational currents within the country's development. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present and attempting to determine just where the point of intersection between China and the rest of the world is. Coming to terms with such an issue will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

Then we will move on to dynamics of growth, which will seek to explain the relative success of China in the era of market reforms. In analyzing political consequences, we will assess how new forms of cooperation and conflict have emerged. This will involve attention to both internal dynamics as well as how rapid development has seen an increasing accumulation of political power in the East. It goes without saying that accelerating growth has led to huge social change, resulting in profound reorganizations of Chinese and Indian society.

This course seeks to address precisely this issue, What is thinking?, through a reading of Martin Heidegger's work  Was Heisst Denken? (""What is Called Thinking?"") Heidegger is relentless in his pursuit of this question and as thorough as he can be. Still, it could be argued that the question remains incompletely answered, presenting itself as a challenge to us in our engagement with it. Was Heisst Denken?

A few principles of the initial Declaration by the United Nations formed the basis of US policy as stipulated by successive administrations from Truman onward namely that: the United States did not seek to make territorial gains; all people had the right to self-determination; global economic cooperation and advancement of social welfare would be central to international relations; and that all will work for a world free of want and fear. A corollary of these principles emerged during the Korean War and extended to the Congo Crisis in Africa: that self-determination would predicated upon democracy, free election, and popular consultation. Yet, as President Kennedy's so-called ordeal in Africa suggests, the execution of US foreign policy in Africa has often veered off course away from these initial principles. The course focused on the concerns that finally prevailed over US foreign policy over time: US-European ties; Cold War rivalry; Non-Alignment antagonisms; and today's Counter-Terrorism. "

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early ""hip hop feminism"" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool? The course will also address broader questions related to representations of Black femininity, people of color in the media, gender and sexual identity construction"

ASRC 6440,Black Girlhood Ethnographies,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 6440, ANTHR 6444",,,,"This graduate seminar recognizes the current critical moment in Black girlhood studies as a pivotal point for addressing questions related to coming of age in the African diaspora, Black feminism, and the analytical power of ethnography. Black girls are hypervisible, both as ""at risk"" and as cultural trendsetters, and simultaneously rendered invisible in public policy discourses. Yet, Black girls' social worlds reveal entrenched racialized and gendered inequalities, and form the basis for some of the most innovative work in the social sciences and the humanities. We will consider Black girlhood studies that fall within the ethnographic tradition, including Elizabeth Chin's Purchasing Power: Black Kids and American Consumer Culture (2001), Oneka LaBennett's She's Mad Real: Popular Culture and West Indian Girls in Brooklyn (2011), and Aimee Meredith Cox's Shapeshifters: Black Girls and the Choreography of Citizenship (2015), using these texts to examine Black girls' complex racialized, gendered, and age-based cultural realities. The course will also explore the transition from girlhood to womanhood, while surveying the borders of interdisciplinarity and what constitutes Black girlhood ethnography by considering historical approaches, films, and ethnographic novels. Other works covered will include Zora Neale Hurston's Their Eyes Were Watching God (1937), Paule Marshall's Brown Girl, Brownstones (1959), and Octavia Butler's Fledgling (2005).  While our primary focus will be on Black girlhood in the U.S. and the Caribbean, broader diasporic treatments such as Céline Sciamma's Girlhood/Bande de Filles (2014) will frame black girlhood in global contexts"

Copernicus, who set the Earth in motion around the sun in the early 16th century, and Newton, who made the universe an infinite expanse filled with gravitational attractive forces, at the end of the 17th, frame this crucial period of European expansion. The new universe was invented at the same time as the discovery and exploitation of the New World and the establishment of new trading relationships with the East. This course, a weekly 400-level seminar, examines the new ideas and approaches to nature promoted by European philosophers and mathematicians as part of this outward-looking enterprise aimed at the practical command of the world. We will read works by such people as Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon, Galileo, Descartes, Newton, and others, as well as important secondary literature, in order to understand how European thought attempted to integrate nature, God, and the state into new ways of making usable knowledge of the world"

Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests"

It will be divided into a number of inter-related modules. After a framing lecture, we will briefly cover the two countries' distinct experiences with colonialism and centralized planning. Then we will move on to dynamics of growth, which will seek to explain the relative success of China in the era of market reforms. In analyzing political consequences, we will assess how new forms of cooperation and conflict have emerged. This will involve attention to both internal dynamics as well as how rapid development has seen an increasing accumulation of political power in the East. It goes without saying that accelerating growth has led to huge social change, resulting in profound reorganizations of Chinese and Indian society. Finally, the course will conclude by returning to our original question – is this indeed The Asian Century? What does the rise of China and India mean for the rest of the world, and how are these two giant nations likely to develop in the future?"

How did the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)—which was made up of but a few dozen members at its founding in 1921—come to rule over China in 1949 and hold on to the reins of government since? This course considers the history of Chinese communism from its origins in the aftermath of the First World War up to the present. In following the CCP along its road to revolution and through its decades in power, we chart the ways in which Chinese communism shaped and shifted the dynamics between state and society in China's tumultuous twentieth century. At the same time, we explore how Chinese communism as an ideological and institutional force influenced and was, in turn, influenced by various global currents and movements, from Cold War politics to radical agrarian insurgencies. This course will equip students to critically engage with questions of revolution, governance, and the place of China in the world today.

Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining ""what China is"" via a consideration of transnational currents within the country's development. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present and attempting to determine just where the point of intersection between China and the rest of the world is. Coming to terms with such an issue will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

While origins and destinations often seem the most significant, modern media and cultural mobility also invite us to consider the experience of being in transit, of what happens as things move from point A to point B. This course examines the function of media in processes of mobilization and immobilization through readings in travel writing and cultural theory (e.g., Goethe, Kafka, Seghers, Simmel, Benjamin, Kracauer). Our guiding questions will include: What kinds of situations tend to create mobility or immobility? To what extent do technologies like the telegraph, telephone, and radio contribute to increased mobility and global connections? And what might studying the experience of mobility and transition reveal about the project of modernity itself?"

ECON 7530,Industry Dynamics,2,Stdnt Opt,Fall (weeks 8-14),,,,,,,"This is an advanced study course in Industry Dynamics. Much improvement has been made in the study of aggregate productivity, investment, and aggregate output dynamics by understanding the micro structure of the economy. This course introduces the main tools exploited in the literature to study these macroeconomic problems and discusses the research frontier. The course opens up with a theory of entrepreneurship and occupational choice. Then it describes firms growth and its impact on industry equilibrium. It introduces techniques for computation of productivity and marginal products at the firm level and its implications for cross-country disparities in income per capital and the life cycle of firms. Next, we analyze economies consistent with industry equilibrium and endogenous long-run growth. For that, we build basic notions on stochastic calculus which are used at the frontier of research. Finally, we study industry equilibrium in open economies and in economies with incomplete markets. The course closes with a normative analysis of industry equilibrium allocations. Due to the brevity of the course, there is only a limited number of papers that can be covered in detail. The course, however, should endow students with the tools necessary to approach the literature and highlight the questions that remain to be answered.

One of the ways we do this is by incorporating adult learning approaches within the seminar's design and educational practice (andragogy, rather than pedagogy). Another way we apply what we study is by mentoring adult learners.  Each student serves as a learning partner to a Cornell employee who is pursuing an educational aim. A journey of mutual learning is a satisfying and meaningful adventure.

We will consider the rise of Hollywood in the age of mass production; the star system; the introduction of sound and the function of the soundtrack; Hollywood's rivalry with television; censorship; the rise of independent film, etc. Weekly screenings introduce major American genres (e.g. science fiction, film noir, the musical) and directors (e.g. Hitchcock, Kubrick, Tarantino)"
ENGL 2771,Africa in Hollywood,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 2771, PMA 2403",(LA-AS),,,"In Eddie Murphy's Coming to America, Africa is a place of nobility, where even lions are at peace with lambs. In contrast, Leonardo DeCaprio's Blood Diamond is a violent look at the role the demand for diamonds has played in destabilizing mineral-rich African countries. But if Hollywood has long been concerned with depicting Africa in particular ways, African filmmakers are at the same time creating their own stories. Popular and scholarly film critics are also contributing to the battle over who speaks for Africa. In this course we will explore these competing images of Africa, questions of imagination versus reality, and the extent to which artists should, if at all, be responsible to the subject of their art"
ENGL 2780,Body as Text: Pleasure and Danger,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"BSOC 2781, FGSS 2780, LGBT 2780",(LA-AS),,,"We experience our bodies as so much a part of who we are that we take them for granted. Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of ""the body"" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called ""gender,"" ""sexuality,"" and ""race""? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous? We'll find out by examining a broad range of evidence from the ancient era to the present day, including literature (Ovid, Kafka, Octavia Butler), philosophy (Plato, Descartes, Judith Butler), film, and the history of science"

Course members will read in relevant published material and write and revise their own work regularly, while reviewing and responding to one another's.

In this course we will explore punk's origins in New York and London, U.S. punk's regional differences (the New York scene's connection to the art and literary worlds, Southern California's skate and surf culture, etc.), its key movements (hardcore, straight edge, riot grrrl, crust, queercore), its race, class and gender relations, and its ongoing influence on global youth culture.

An introductory grounding in theories of social death will allow us to explore the racial anxiety that gave birth to the genre and trace its development throughout the hemisphere. The course seeks to broaden the genre to include novels that normally would not be considered antecedents and ultimately poses the following questions: What can the figure of the zombie teach us about our evolving relationship to race? What does the recent proliferation of zombie-related television shows, movies, books and video games say about our contemporary racial anxieties?"
ENGL 2960,Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 6785, LING 2285, LING 6285",(LA-AS),,,"Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation"

Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120"

We will look at his varieties of genre (fabliau, saint's life, epic, lyric, sermon, beast fable, romance); at the representations of men and women; and at the ways in which Chaucer's contemporaries handled similar literary themes, subjects, and structures"
ENGL 3290,Losing Paradise: Milton's Great Epic,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Whose story is the story of the fall? Milton's poem about ""man's first disobedience"" begins, in fact, with a story about an earlier act of falling, that of Satan, and inserts the human perspective in a larger drama of which Adam and Eve are at first largely unaware. Why can't the story of falling be told as a single plot or from a single perspective, and what does this tell us about the human, about history, and about (poetic) narrative? How does the poem's echoing of earlier texts raise questions (literary, political, philosophical) about the problem of finding a single voice with which to tell this story? We will read Paradise Lost in full, with attention to excerpts from biblical, theological, political, and classical texts"
ENGL 3390,Jane Austen,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that students who have read Jane Austen must be in want of an opportunity to continue that delicious experience, and that those who have not read her novels should. This course explores Austen's characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems which resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen's importance in literary history as well as her continuing attraction in the twenty-first century.

ENGL 3560,Thinking from a Different Place: Indigenous Philosophies,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AIIS 3560, AMST 3562",(LA-AS),,,"Native and Western philosophies serve similar functions: they organize societies and construct those taken-for-granted truths we all operate from, but rarely examine. Even as such ""truths"" create ideas about how the world and universe work, these differences can be a source of conflict between people groups. In this class, we'll examine how Indigenous knowledge systems are formed and expressed, and what can be the result when people with conflicting knowledge systems interact with one another. Through readings, discussions, lectures, films, a guest presentation, group work, and other course assignments, we'll consider Indigenous North American knowledge systems and worldviews with a particular eye toward how these ideas are related to geographic space, social structure, culture, science, and contemporary global problems"
ENGL 3585,Feminist Literary Traditions,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,FGSS 3585,(LA-AS),,,"To what extent are there specific forms or themes that characterize women's literature? How have women writers both extended and revised each other's work? What issues have been most pressing for feminist writers? What political questions most vexing? This course will consider these questions as we read primarily British and US 19th- 21st century writers and examine what use they make of both canonical and experimental literary forms. To what extent, that is, does the need to tell a new story force or enable a writer to develop a new form in which to write? Reading may include texts by Jane Austen, Pat Barker, Alison Bechdel, Louise Erdrich, Maxine Hong Kingston, Toni Morrison, and Monique Truong"

Beginning with the legacy of medieval Latin, it traces the rise of the short, vernacular poem in a variety of social, literary, and material contexts. Our approaches include: the place of the lyric in manuscript culture; the social facts and literary fictions of oral performance; the political environments in which lyrics come to be; the relationships of lyric to other literary forms in the European Middle Ages; England's status as a trilingual community that creates contexts for lyric production and reception in Latin, English, and French; critical and historical theories of the lyric as genre, performance, and defining literary form"

Among other ideas, the course will explore the social construction of black womanhood; social and literary hierarchies which locate black women and their writing in specific ways; aspects of black women's creativity.

We'll read from some of the great mid-century critics (Pauline Kael, Randall Jarrell), as well as the many critics who have flourished in the contemporary era (Updike, Vendler, Wood, Dargis, et al.). Our goal will be to better understand, if not answer, the ancient question, ""What's the point of criticism?"", as well as its modern variant, ""Why should anyone care what That Guy thinks?"""

Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120"
ENGL 6195,Medieval Lyric,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 4195, MEDVL 4195, MEDVL 6195",,,,"This offers an in depth survey the traditions of lyric poetry during the English Middle Ages. Beginning with the legacy of medieval Latin, it traces the rise of the short, vernacular poem in a variety of social, literary, and material contexts. Our approaches include: the place of the lyric in manuscript culture; the social facts and literary fictions of oral performance; the political environments in which lyrics come to be; the relationships of lyric to other literary forms in the European Middle Ages; England's status as a trilingual community that creates contexts for lyric production and reception in Latin, English, and French; critical and historical theories of the lyric as genre, performance, and defining literary form"
ENGL 6230,"A New Atlantis: Early Modern Literature, Science, and Empire",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,STS 6231,,,,"This interdisciplinary seminar introduces the fields of literature and science studies, with a particular focus on early modern natural history and philosophy. How did early moderns produce authoritative knowledge about the body, the natural world, and the cosmos? What discourses and practices enabled claims to knowledge before the coherence of a single entity called science? What did early moderns do when they composed a poem or performed an experiment? How did those practices inform one another, if they did? We will survey a range of genres, including drama, poetry, romance, philosophical prose, the familiar essay, the humanist letter, and the experimental report. The seminar will also feature scholarship from the history of science, science and technology studies, philosophy of science, literary theory and literary criticism"
ENGL 6390,"Studies in Romanticism: Wordsworth, Keats, and Critics",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"This seminar will be a close encounter with the poetry of Keats and Wordsworth, occasioning an exploration of how to write and read literary criticism. Some questions we'll consider: How can we think about poetry in terms of its reception—how it fits into a social, literary, and cultural history—and also in terms of its stunning gratuitousness, its inexplicable production? How did Keats and Wordsworth each achieve a recognizable voice and (eventually) cultural authority, while radically altering poetic diction and offending class-inflected taste? As well as reading some recently written critical essays that are especially far-reaching or especially problematic, we will read Keats's and Wordsworth's own critical writing. Requirements: oral presentations in class, plus the drafting of two critical papers and completion of one"
ENGL 6425,World Literature: The Case of the 19th Century,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"In this course, we will read recent theorists of world literature, including Damrosch, Spivak, Moretti, Friedman, Dimock, Walkowitz, Hayot, Apter, and Mufti, and we will trace a genealogy of the term back to Goethe and Marx. We will think about how important the British Empire and English literature and language have been to processes of globalization, and we will focus on a number of nineteenth-century Anglophone translations and theories of translation. We will train a skeptical eye on the Eurocentric and national categories that currently organize literary study. What texts might be included in global canon of nineteenth-century world literature? How do poetry and prose circulate differently? What political power attaches to literacy and to literature? How do oral traditions travel? And do new geographies require new chronologies?"
ENGL 6507,Black Women Writers: Books to Screen,4,Graded,Spring,,,"ASRC 4507, ASRC 6507, ENGL 4507, FGSS 4507, FGSS 6507",,,,"An exploration of writing by representative black women writers. We will examine specific texts as well as necessary critical and theoretical ideas which have been generated through, or with which this literature is in conversation. Students will develop critical thinking and other analytical skills as they engage the meanings of the politics of black women's lives in cross-cultural contexts. We will therefore consistently broaden the definition of black women's writing so that the trans-national contexts of this writing become visible. Among other ideas, the course will explore the social construction of black womanhood; social and literary hierarchies which locate black women and their writing in specific ways; aspects of black women's creativity. Moving beyond the questions of the representation of black women by others, our focus will be on the way that black women represent themselves"
ENGL 6600,Erotics of Visuality,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 6601, FGSS 6610, LGBT 6600, PMA 6670",,,,"""The pleasure of the text,"" Roland Barthes writes, ""is that moment when my body pursues its own ideas – for my body does not have the same ideas I do.""  What is this erotics of the text, and what has it been up to lately at the movies?  Are new movies giving our bodies new ideas?  In the context of recent cinema, how might we read and revise classic works of psychoanalytic, feminist, and queer theory on sexuality and visual studies? Although we will read essays by Sigmund Freud, Jacques Lacan, Roland Barthes, Christian Metz, Laura Mulvey, Lee Edelman, Slavoj Zizek, and other theorists whose work on visuality has been influential for a long time, we will focus on cinema of the past decade or so, including the work of such auteurs as Pedro Almodóvar, Olivier Assayas, Matthew Barney, Catherine Breillat, Claire Denis, Michael Haneke, Todd Haynes, Abbas Kiarostami, David Lynch, Steve McQueen, Gaspar Noé, Gus Van Sant, and Wong Kar-wai"
ENGL 6635,Literature of the Civil War and Reconstruction,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"The works we will read this term imagine and embody a nation's survival when it faces war within its own boundaries. With a primary focus on poetry and novels, we will also look at photographs, political cartoons, recruitment posters, and trading cards—items that give a visual resonance to the iconography of national violence. Asking about gendered and racialized embodiments associated with the national project on both sides of the conflict, we will want to find out how gender, race, and nation are written into 19th-century North America"
ENGL 6785,Linguistic Theory and Poetic Structure,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 2960, LING 2285, LING 6285",,,,"Poems are among the most highly structured linguistic objects that human beings produce. While some of the devices used in poetry are arbitrary and purely conventional, most are natural extensions of structural properties inherent in natural language itself. The aim of this course is to reveal the ways in which poetry is structured at every level, from rhyme to metaphor, and to show how certain results of modern linguistics can usefully be applied to the analysis and interpretation of poetry. After introducing some of the basic concepts of modern phonology, syntax and semantics, it will be shown how literary notions such as rhyme, meter, enjambment and metaphor can be formally defined in linguistic terms. These results will then be applied to the analysis of particular poems and shown to yield novel and interesting insights into both their structure and interpretation"
ENGL 6811,James Baldwin,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 6811, LGBT 6811",,,,"James Baldwin is one of the most incisive interpreters of the English language and of American life. In this course, we will pay careful attention to Baldwin's essays and novels, and how his style in each form changes over the course of his illustrious career. We will consider Baldwin's work against a variegated historical context and how his work pries open America's literary, cultural, and political imagination. Also, we will supplement primary texts with shorter pieces by his contemporaries and new critical essays in black queer studies that re-conceptualize Baldwin's enterprise. The themes of the course will include: the intersection of race and sexuality; the forms of intimacy and kinship; the politics of love; and, the role of the artist/intellectual"
ENGL 6970,Cosmopolitanism and Post-Enlightenment,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 6970, GOVT 6779",,,,"This course will examine cosmopolitanism as a cultural, moral, and political concept both historically, with reference primarily to the eighteenth century, and theoretically, in contemporary debates. The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists"
ENGL 6995,Race and Time,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AAS 4555, AAS 6995, ENGL 4550",,,,"Race, comparison, and time—what do these terms have to do with each other? What does it mean to be in time, or out of time?  What are some other ways of inhabiting time, or of being inhabited by time? What is the time of the racialized subject? How is time and temporality figured in literature? Some of the writers we'll be reading in the course include Carolivia Herron, Carlos Bulosan, Jamaica Kincaid, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, and Joy Kogawa.

Exploring various theoretical approaches and schools of criticism (e.g., Marxism, feminism, deconstruction, hermeneutics, structuralism, psychoanalysis, postcolonial theory, minority studies, queer studies), we will explore these and other themes and examine some of the underlying—and often competing—epistemological and political claims made about them. No previous knowledge of theory is required"
ENGL 7100,Advanced Old English: The Anglo-Saxons and the Bible,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"How was the Bible read and understood in Anglo-Saxon England? How were biblical narratives transmitted? Were the Old and New Testaments read in equal parts? Who was permitted to translate or recite scripture? Were there standard theories of translation or of biblical interpretation? What types of audiences had access to written bibles or to oral accounts? In this course we will read examples of Anglo-Saxon biblical translations, sermons, commentaries, saints' lives, and poems, all of which indicate a surprisingly rich and prolific culture of scriptural production and innovation in the vernacular. In addition to close readings, we will consider theoretical approaches to medieval translation theory, and to different aspects and enactments of piety. [Primary texts available in Old English and in translation.]"

Taking posthumanism, queer theory, and critical race theory as our guiding tools, this course will survey science writing, manifesto, and African-American gay erotica in the context of AIDS, among others, to examine what forms of non-normative sexualities and their potential dangers are unleashed as the human/nonhuman divide is radically challenged. We will approach this topic through lively discussion as well as formal and creative academic essays"

Through case studies of familial and conjugal love in Africa, Asia, the US, Europe, and South and Latin America, the course will examine the debates about and enactment's of what constitutes the appropriate way to show love and affection in different cultures and historical contexts. Among the themes we will explore are questions of sexuality, marriage, kinship, and gender rights. A final unit will examine these themes through modern technologies such as the Internet, scientific advances in medicine, and a growing awareness that who and how we love is anything but simple or universal"

This course seeks to give students the opportunity to wrestle with what's at stake in this process of identification, as well as the alternatives to identity (and gender and sexuality) that have arisen in earlier and other cultures. From ancient pedagogical eros, through medieval conceptions of nature and its abuses, to early modern mappings of sexual strangeness onto non-European bodies, we'll examine the prehistory of our modern identities, even as we engage with the limits of those identities here and now"

It will concentrate on selected themes such as modernity, nationalism, and colonization in order to encourage students to challenge preconceived assumptions about Middle Eastern women, discuss some of the many roles they have played in social change, and think comparatively about gender, history, and social life. Students will be introduced to a wide array of literature produced in Western Europe and elsewhere pertaining to the Middle Eastern societies and cultures for a critical analysis of how knowledge and discourses about gender roles had been constructed in the course of the nineteenth century. In addition, students will learn about the ways in which Islamic law and legal institutions defined and managed the issues in relation to women's status as well as sexuality and marriage as social institutions. We will investigate how historical and contemporary political and social forces such as nationalism, colonialism, and revolutions operated in the course of the twentieth century, shaping both women's movement and advocating for women's rights before the law, access to education and family issues. Finally, this course will introduce students to the debates on ""gender as a useful category"" by connecting it to the recent and growing scholarship on masculinity and queer studies in the Middle East. By doing so, we will analyze relationality of women, men, and transgender categories and their political and social implications in the past and the present"

Yet the way we think about the body has a history of its own. This class looks at how the idea of ""the body"" gets constructed over time. How has the body come to have attributes called ""gender,"" ""sexuality,"" and ""race""? Why have some bodies been seen as monstrous, perverted, and unholy, others as gorgeous, normal, and divine? What makes bodies pleasurable and dangerous?

We will approach theory as a tool for analyzing relations of power and a means of transforming ways of thinking and living. In particular, we will investigate the cultural, social, and historical assumptions that shape the possibilities and problematics of gender and sexuality. Throughout we will attend to specific histories of class, race, ethnicity, culture, nation, religion and sexuality, with an eye to their particular incitements to and challenges for feminist thinking and politics"

It asks how inequalities within and across gender categories are created in the process of social change, how gender intersects with class, race, and culture to shape the way change is experienced, and how institutions and social spaces become gendered. The course begins with the study of theoretical approaches or gender planning models to promote gender equality in policies and programs. We then turn to specific substantive areas of social life to consider how gender operates in different spaces, and we consider prospects for change beyond gender planning models in the form of social movements, politics, and the law"

What kinds of rhetorical maneuvers were employed to explicate the pleasurable, the beautiful, the virtuous and the sublime? In addition to the visual dimension of the female body, we will study the regulation and training of female actresses' voices and gestures to analyze how they complicate or enable female silence. Besides Goethe and Schiller, we will read texts by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing, Immanuel Kant, Novalis and essays, texts and memoirs by female actresses, writers and poets such as Charlotte Ackermann and Karoline von Günderrode"

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early ""hip hop feminism"" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture? What are the relationships between queer theory and hip hop studies? Does hip hop allow spaces for alternative femininities? How do Black girls use hip hop as a pedagogical tool?

This course seeks to give students the opportunity to wrestle with what's at stake in this process of identification, as well as the alternatives to identity (and gender and sexuality) that have arisen in earlier and other cultures. From ancient pedagogical eros, through medieval conceptions of nature and its abuses, to early modern mappings of sexual strangeness onto non-European bodies, we'll examine the prehistory of our modern identities, even as we engage with the limits of those identities here and now"

Whenever possible, we will use texts and images produced by the Revolutionaries themselves"
FREN 3480,Intellectuals: A French History,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(CA-AS),,,"The concept of ""intellectual"" - the writer or scholar who takes a political commitment - was born in France at the end of the nineteenth century.  From the Dreyfus Affaire to the recent polemics on French ""identity,"" passing through Vichy, the Algerian War and May 68, intellectuals established a symbiotic relationship between culture and politics, becoming a sort of national brand, object of both admiration and contempt outside of the country.  The aim of this course is to revisit some crucial moments of this history, focusing on different attempts to define the nature and function of the intellectual, from Emile Zola to Jean-Paul Sartre, from Simone de Beauvoir to Michel Foucault"

This course is an opportunity to think about and to enact certain practices of attentiveness and concentration, drawing largely from religious, literary, artistic, philosophical and anthropological sources. We'll be trying various kinds of exercises - from reading poems and looking at paintings to eating more slowly - as we read about the ways in which our seneses reach out to the world, and as we think together about how technology may be used in ways that are not, strictly speaking, technological. This course is for students at all levels, from all backgrounds, graduate and undergraduate, with the understanding that we all need an excuse to slow down and observe the world - and ourselves - a little more carefully"

FREN 3920,Totalitarianism: History and Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,HIST 3920,(CA-AS),,,"The concept of totalitarianism depicts the twentieth century as an age of wars and genocide.  Its history, nevertheless, reveals a multiplicity of scholarly and political uses.  The aim of this course is to outline the trajectory of this controversial idea, from fascist Italy in the 1920s to the present, passing through the harrowing experiences of Stalinism and National Socialism.  Shaping political theory and historiography, this concept reveals some virtues and many limits, which explain why it has been so enthusiastically endorsed and virulently criticized.  This course will take a critical look at the crucial pieces of this debate"

These theorists have systematically been a crucial reference in the making of American feminism since the 1960s. Yet this selection of French feminists may not adequately reflect the complexity of the actual French feminist landscape. Is there even such a thing as a discretely French feminism? While mapping out the theoretical legacy of the so-called French feminism, this course will explore the complexity of the dialogues between French and American feminists since the 60s in order to understand the most recent debates in gender studies in France. The readings will include, among others: Simone de Beauvoir, Hélène Cixous, Luce Irigaray, Christine Delphy, Julia Kristeva, Monique Wittig, Geneviève Fraisse, Françoise Collin"

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults. This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"

The guiding principle behind this writing seminar is that there is a relationship between the form of a particular sport – what happens on the field – and the fans it produces. The difference, then, between a Yankees and a Cowboys fan is not just a jersey, but a worldview. Students will practice academic writing skills by analyzing these worldviews as expressed in the books and films surrounding specific sports themselves. These will include Nick Hornby's Fever Pitch, Phil Alden Robinson's Field of Dreams, and Leni Riefenstahl's Olympia, as well as critical works by Immanuel Kant, Susan Sonntag, and Hans Ulrich Gumbrecht"
GERST 1117,FWS: Just Friends?,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"In popular culture and literature, in the humanities and in the social sciences, friendship – a relationship of choice without institutional foundation – is a topic that allows for the exploration of the concept of community. We speak of 'friending' someone or being 'Facebook friends,' but can we define friendship? Plato and Aristotle already asked: Are friends alike or do opposites attract? Can a good friendship end? Other questions recently emerged: Can individuals of the same sexual orientation be friends? Is friendship between humans and animals possible? How does one mourn the end of a friendship?

Our seminar will explore key terms in the revolutionary models of critical analysis these thinkers pioneered: historical materialism, post-metaphysical philosophy, and psychoanalysis.  This will mean articulating points of contrast as well as convergence.  Discussions and writing exercises will focus on texts that created the discursive framework for critiquing society and culture today.  Our method will proceed from the premise that critical reading, thinking, and writing are inseparable moments in the same operation of critique.  The question that guides that method will be: Do alternative ways of thinking exist in opposition to the ones we view as natural, inevitable, or universal?"

In analyzing political consequences, we will assess how new forms of cooperation and conflict have emerged.

GOVT 3557,U.S. Exceptionalism Questioned: Comparative Political Economy,4,Graded,Fall,,,"AEM 3557, ILRIC 3557, NBA 5300",(SBA-AS),,,"Do you want to learn the discussion-based case method as taught at the Harvard Business School? Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to ""the West;"" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change. "
GOVT 3603,US Peacekeeping in Africa; From Congo to South Sudan,4,Graded,Fall,,,ASRC 3607,(HA-AS),,,"At the conclusion of World War II, the US ushered in a new international order based on the principles of the Atlantic Charter, which became the basis for the United Nations Charter. A few principles of the initial Declaration by the United Nations formed the basis of US policy as stipulated by successive administrations from Truman onward namely that: the United States did not seek to make territorial gains; all people had the right to self-determination; global economic cooperation and advancement of social welfare would be central to international relations; and that all will work for a world free of want and fear. A corollary of these principles emerged during the Korean War and extended to the Congo Crisis in Africa: that self-determination would predicated upon democracy, free election, and popular consultation. Yet, as President Kennedy's so-called ordeal in Africa suggests, the execution of US foreign policy in Africa has often veered off course away from these initial principles. The course focused on the concerns that finally prevailed over US foreign policy over time: US-European ties; Cold War rivalry; Non-Alignment antagonisms; and today's Counter-Terrorism. "
GOVT 3625,Modern Political Philosophy,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,PHIL 3460,(KCM-AS),,,"This course will primarily focus on studying and scrutinizing general conceptions of justice. Topics explored typically include liberty,economic equality, democracy, community, the general welfare, and toleration.

Starting with the Greeks and ending in the Medieval era of Aquinas and Dante, this course introduces students to the central debates and questions that have shaped political theory: questions of political legitimacy, constitutional theory, public discourse and citizenship. This course is designed to be taken before PHIL 1920"
GOVT 3633,Politics and Culture,4,Stdnt Opt,Spring,,,SOC 2480,(HA-AS),,,"Focuses on currently salient themes of nationalism, multiculturalism, and democracy. It explores such questions as who is a citizen; what is a nation; what is a political institution; and how do bonds of solidarity form in modern civil society.

GOVT 3726,Revolution,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,HIST 3626,(HA-AS),(GHB),,"In 1989, following the anti-Communist revolutions in the Eastern Bloc countries, Francis Fukuyama famously proclaimed ""the end of history"" and predicted the final global victory of economic and political liberalism.  Marxism had been definitely defeated and the era of revolutions was over.  Yet, in the last two decades, revolutions have been spreading across the globe with remarkable speed: from the color revolutions in the former Soviet Union and Balkan states, to the Arab Spring and the widespread anti-globalization and anti-austerity protests around the world.  This course will offer a comparative study of the history and theory of modern revolutions—from the American and French revolutions of the 18th century to the anti-colonial independence struggles of the postwar world—with the goal of attaining a more nuanced and contextualized understanding of the revolutions of our time. We will explore the causes and motivations of diverse revolutionary movements, placing particular emphasis on the political ideas that inspired them.  We will read works by Paine, Rousseau, Robespierre, Sieyes, L'Ouverture, Marx, Tocqueville, Lenin, Luxembourg, Mao, Fanon, and others.  The course is designed as an introductory class and no previous knowledge of the history or political theory we will be covering is required"
GOVT 3785,Civil Disobedience,4,Graded,Fall,,,AMST 3785,(KCM-AS),,,"This course will expose students to the theory and practice of civil disobedience in historical and contemporary perspectives. Do citizens have obligations to obey unjust laws? What makes disobedience civil rather than criminal? How do people take power into their own hands without recourse to violence? How has political dissent transformed in a digital era? And how do acts of protest influence public opinion and policy? We will pursue answers to these questions and others through studying both classic theorists of civil disobedience and contemporary debates about whistleblowing, direct action, nonviolence, and hacktivism"
GOVT 3867,The Causes of War,4,Graded,Fall,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course surveys leading theories of the causes of interstate war-that is, large-scale organized violence between the armed forces of states. Why is war a recurring feature of international politics? Are democracies more peaceful than other types of states, and if so what explains this ""democratic peace?"" Why do democratic publics seem to reward threats to use force by ""rallying around the flag"" in support of their governments? Does the inexorable pattern of the rise and fall of nations lead to cycles of great power wars throughout history? These and other questions will be examined in our survey of theories of war at three levels of analysis: the individual and small groups, domestic politics, and the international system. Topics include (1) theoretical explanations for war; (2) evaluation of the evidence for the various explanations; (3) the impact of nuclear weapons on international politics; (4) ethics and warfare; (5) the uses and limitations of air power"
GOVT 3967,What is China?,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASIAN 3395, CAPS 3967",(CA-AS),(GB),,"China is often thought of as being isolated from the outside world.  It is imagined as existing in historic seclusion, and, following the establishment of the People's Republic, as pursuing a path of autarky. Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining ""what China is"" via a consideration of transnational currents within the country's development. However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present and attempting to determine just where the point of intersection between China and the rest of the world is. Coming to terms with such an issue will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

We will investigate the various stable and shifting elements in the evolution of the conflict including conflicting Israeli and Palestinian narratives and mythologies about the nature of the conflict. Among many issues to be addressed are: the relationship of this conflict to the history of European colonialism in the Middle East, the emergence of Pan-Arabism and Islamism, the various currents in Zionism and its relationship to Judaism, the implication of great power rivalry in the Middle East, the different causes and political repercussions of the four Arab-Israeli wars, efforts at peacemaking including Oslo and Camp David, and the significance of the two Palestinian uprisings"

GOVT 4019,Introductory Probability and Applied Statistics,4,Graded,Fall,,,GOVT 6019,(SBA-AS),,,"The goal of this course is to introduce probability and statistics as fundamental building blocks for quantitative political analysis, with regression modeling as a focal application. We will begin with a brief survey of probability theory, types of measurements, and descriptive statistics. The bulk of the course then addresses inferential statistics, covering in detail sampling, methods for estimating unknown quantities, and methods for evaluating competing hypotheses. We will see how to formally assess estimators, and some basic principles that help to ensure optimality. Along the way, we will introduce the use of regression models to specify social scientific hypotheses, and employ our expanding repertoire of statistical concepts to understand and interpret estimates based on our data. Weekly lab exercises require students to deploy the methods both 'by hand' so they can grasp the basic mathematics, and by computer to meet the conceptual demands of non-trivial examples and prepare for independent research. Some time will be spent reviewing algebra, calculus, and elementary logic, as well as introducing computer statistical packages"
GOVT 4021,American Conservative Thought,4,Graded,Fall,,,AMST 4021,(KCM-AS),,,"American conservative thought rests on assumptions that are strikingly different from those made by mainstream American liberals.  However, conservative thinkers are themselves committed to principles that are both quite varied and sometimes contradictory.  This course examines the assumptions upon which rest the libertarian, market/economic, and cultural/traditional strains of American conservatism and asks whether the tensions between them weaken or strengthen conservative thought as an alternative to mainstream liberalism"
GOVT 4051,The Postmodern Presidency: Election 2016,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 4305,(CA-AS),,,"This semester we will examine the construction of a presidential imaginary- how the president, as represented in literature, film, television, advertising- shapes public policy and influences political opinion. Our focus will be on iconic presidents (Lincoln, JFK, Nixon, Reagan, Obama) and First Ladies (Hillary Clinton, Laura Bush, Michelle Obama) that have served as recurrent subjects for a diverse range of media. How are past presidents reimagined in a contemporary context? How have cultural representations impacted the institution of the presidency? Our seminar throughout this exciting election year will be guided by a central question: what cultural forms are needed to sustain a body politic?"
GOVT 4283,Latino Politics as Racial Politics,4,Graded,Fall,,,LSP 4283,(SBA-AS),(HB),,"This class will examine the history and contemporary role of Latinos as a minority group in the U.S. political system. This course is intended as an overview of the political position of Latinos y Latinas in the United States. We place special emphasis on how Latinos became racial group which allows us to focus on political relationships between Latinos and non-Latinos as they relate to political institutions, political parties, voting coalitions, representation and public policy"
GOVT 4291,Politics of Science,4,Graded,Fall,,,"BSOC 4291, STS 4291",(SBA-AS),,,"This course examines scientific controversies that become political. Why does some science become politicized rather than normalized and routinized? How do societies deal with collective uncertainty and risk entailed in authoritative scientific findings? How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science? What do interest-based explanations of politics tell us and leave out? An archetypal case is climate change, but it is one of many. Topics range broadly and will be adjusted to student interests"

First, we will examine various approaches to the question of nationalism, using Benedict Anderson's Imagined Communities as our basic reference. We will then test the applicability of these general theories to the Arab World through our examination of specific case studies"
GOVT 4496,Power,4,Graded,Fall,,,GOVT 6496,(HA-AS),,,"This seminar inquires into the interrelation between two meanings of the concept of power:  ""power over"" or control power and ""power to"" or protean power. Control power is based on the notion that actors can shape the social context in which they operate in predictable ways. Protean power highlights unintended and unanticipated events and processes that destabilize or upset control. Control power focuses on actors' abilities to maneuver in a world of risk to cause outcomes they deem desirable. Protean power highlights actors' evolving agility as they adapt in situations of uncertainty. The two kinds of power circulate and interact in settings in which actor practices acquiesce, resist and innovate. This seminar will read political theorists such as Aristotle, Machiavelli, Hobbes, Clausewitz, Foucault, Arendt and Hayek as they probe the meaning of power"
GOVT 4726,Punitive Society,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,FREN 4726,(CA-AS),,,"Punitive Society examines the phenomena of mass incarceration and the death penalty as represented in philosophy, law, literature and film.  We will address the genealogy of punishment, the absence of a philosophically rigorous Abolitionist argument in the Western tradition and the racial politics of the carceral system (what Michelle Alexander has called, ""the new Jim Crow,"") Have literature and film provided more pertinent critiques of incarceration and the death penalty? We will focus on the U.S. and France in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries as our cases. Texts will include works by theorists Cesare Beccaria, Rousseau, Kant, Foucault, Derrida, Camus, Robert Badinter, Michelle Alexander, Loic Wacquant; writers Victor Hugo, Albert French, Ernest Gaines, Jean Genet; and filmmakers: Robert Bresson, Lars von Trier, Ozu, Fritz Lang"
GOVT 4867,Through the Prison Threshold,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ANTHR 4071, SOC 4860",,,,"This seminar will explore the rise of mass incarceration and punitive containment strategies around the globe. Considering prison a threshold that resists outsiders' efforts to comprehend inmate experience, we will read from works of prison ethnography, history, film and memoirs that approach different cultures of confinement and consider how the prison has become a problematic zone of state experimentation. Emphasis will be given to works that shed light on the professional and religious vocations that straddle prison worlds and the world beyond the prison walls, helping to generate new ethical relationships as well as political associations for social justice with captive state populations"

While China may not necessarily be the sole determinant of the type of security order that will prevail in Asia, it has a profound influence on the region and potentially on the global order as well. To gain an understanding of security issues in Asia today, the seminar attempts to come to terms with the evolving nature of China's foreign policy and national security strategies. The course then concentrates on the most influential academic work on China's foreign relations and national security policies that has been published since the end of the Cold War.   "
GOVT 4949,Honors Seminar: Thesis Clarification and Research,4,Graded,Fall,acceptance into honors program,,,,,,"This seminar creates a structured environment in which honors students will examine different  research approaches and methods and construct a research design for their own theses—a thesis proposal that probes a new or inadequately researched question of importance to the discipline of political science or political theory. Apart from being a thesis writing workshop, the honors research class serves as a capstone course giving an overview of the different topics and methods addressed by students of politics. Members of the class will do extensive reading in published work relevant to their topics, and write a critical summary of that literature. Each member of the class will present their research design and central question(s) to the class for constructive criticism. By the end of the class, each honors student will have written the first chapter of the thesis, including the statement of the question, literature review, key definitions, methodology, and identification of data source(s). They will be working closely with an individual faculty adviser, as well as interacting with the research class. Students are strongly encouraged to examine some past honors theses on reserve at Kroch library in order to get an idea of the standards a government thesis must meet"

These forms of data are now extremely common in the social sciences. In the first three weeks we attain mastery of some of the more intricate Stata and R post-estimation procedures. These are essential for interpreting typical models of categories and counts, since in the typical application, effects on the mean of the dependent variable are not constant but vary with settings of the explanatory variables. We then proceed to the key application, the analysis of non-continuous dependent variables. Each student will be required to actively participate in a group presentation of the nuts and bolts of a data analysis using this kind of data, either assigned by the instructor or based off peer research. Students with active quantitative research projects are encouraged to join the course for an opportunity to hone the analysis, and to receive feedback from peers and the instructor"

Such data are now commonplace, presenting additional complications but also offering statistical and quasi-experimental leverage via repeated measurements and change-points. The main topics will be the use and choice among robust standard errors and fixed and random effects estimators, a variety of multi-level specifications and their estimation and interpretation, and a key application called multi-level regression and post-stratification (MRP). At the end of the course, we will examine dynamic models, focusing on their assumptions, interpretation, and related pitfalls.

We will be particularly interested in the foundational assumptions that underpin the connections between empirical reality, language, and statistical analysis. While these foundational assumptions are often taken for granted by social scientists, they vary dramatically between social science disciplines.  The implicit contradiction between that variance and their doxic acceptance within disciplines will be a primary focus of the course"

Emphasis will be placed on the historical relationship between institutional growth and state formation, parliamentary rules as both arrangements within which the ""rational choices"" of legislators are played out and as deliberate, constructions and allocations of political influence, and the use of legislative behavior as evidence in the analysis of fundamental principles of politics. Because the literature on the lower chamber is generally more rich, the House of Representatives will receive greater attention than the Senate"
GOVT 6242,Experiment and Survey Design,4,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"This course is designed to provide doctoral students in political science with an introduction to experiment and survey design. Students will discuss all major types of experiments (e.g. field, lab, survey, natural, and economics), methods for analyzing experimental data, and methods for designing questionnaires that appear in experiments. The goal will be to convey a rich appreciation for the possibilities that experimental research offers, as well as a thoughtful understanding of the shortcomings of this research method. In addition, students will gain valuable knowledge in questionnaire design that can be used not only in experiments but in all forms of research that involve surveys (such as focus groups, one-on-one interviews, etc.).   "

It will be divided into a number of inter-related modules. After a framing lecture, we will briefly cover the two countries' distinct experiences with colonialism and centralized planning. Then we will move on to dynamics of growth, which will seek to explain the relative success of China in the era of market reforms. In analyzing political consequences, we will assess how new forms of cooperation and conflict have emerged. This will involve attention to both internal dynamics as well as how rapid development has seen an increasing accumulation of political power in the East. It goes without saying that accelerating growth has led to huge social change, resulting in profound reorganizations of Chinese and Indian society. Finally, the course will conclude by returning to our original question – is this indeed The Asian Century? What does the rise of China and India mean for the rest of the world, and how are these two giant nations likely to develop in the future?"

Do rights suspend democracy or establish its preconditions? What are the best procedures for democratic decision-making? How does democracy deal with difference? Is democracy best understood as a form of government or a practice of resistance to domination?"

The aim will be to elaborate critically the universalist and egalitarian premises of the Enlightenment notion of cosmopolitical subjects and to evaluate what progressive or ideological functions this notion continues to play in discourses on sovereignty, human rights, religious tolerance, and cultural dissemination and aesthetic community. Works by Cicero, Hobbes, Adam Smith, Rousseau, Kant, and Marx will be read with those by Arendt, Balibar, Derrida, Habermas, Honig, and other contemporary theorists"

This course considers the history of Chinese communism from its origins in the aftermath of the First World War up to the present. In following the CCP along its road to revolution and through its decades in power, we chart the ways in which Chinese communism shaped and shifted the dynamics between state and society in China's tumultuous twentieth century. At the same time, we explore how Chinese communism as an ideological and institutional force influenced and was, in turn, influenced by various global currents and movements, from Cold War politics to radical agrarian insurgencies. This course will equip students to critically engage with questions of revolution, governance, and the place of China in the world today.

The last two decades of the 19th century and the first two of the twentieth marked an abrupt shift in the life experiences of the American people. Daily life changed radically from 1877-1920, as the agrarian republic gave way to an urbanizing consumer society. Debates about ""progress"" characterized the period, as new technologies, new peoples, new forms of politics and culture, and new patterns of living transformed the United States. This course will explore the political, economic, diplomatic and cultural history of the Gilded age and Progressive eras, focusing on the ways American tried to make sense of, to order, to moralize and to shape rapid change"

Copernicus, who set the Earth in motion around the sun in the early 16th century, and Newton, who made the universe an infinite expanse filled with gravitational attractive forces, at the end of the 17th, frame this crucial period of European expansion. The new universe was invented at the same time as the discovery and exploitation of the New World and the establishment of new trading relationships with the East. This course, a weekly 400-level seminar, examines the new ideas and approaches to nature promoted by European philosophers and mathematicians as part of this outward-looking enterprise aimed at the practical command of the world.

The comparative aspect of the approach to the study of empires is emphasized in this seminar partly because some legacies of the empire have been appropriated by the post-World War II American empire. It is also because the seminar addresses the growing controversy over and publications about the historical significance and contemporary forms of ""empire"" in general. In this respect too, comparison as a methodological device is important for this seminar in view of the weaknesses inherent in past area-studies-oriented approaches to the Japanese and American empires"

Since the beginning of the republic, American intellectuals, politicians and businessmen have extolled the exceptionalism of America. In a world of diverse forms of capitalism, can this view be sustained? Is America a shining city on the hill or a darkened city in the valley? Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to ""the West;"" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change. "

ILROB 3730,"Culture, Leadership, and Change: Engaging Students in Campus Life and Beyond",4,GradeNoAud,Fall or spring,,,,,,,"What does it mean to be a Cornellian and engaged in campus life and the world beyond? Culture defines who we are as a member of Cornell University and how we should act toward one another and in the wider world. This course will examine the concept of culture and apply it to our role as Cornellians. Values matter. They tell us what is important in our lives. Effective leaders use culture to strengthen members' commitment to the organization and keep members focused on the organization's goals. In that sense, culture is a powerful form of social control that can be utilized to encourage and discourage specific behaviors. As an institution, Cornell University espouses values that all Cornellians believe in. Academic excellence, collective and individual responsibility, philanthropy, and fairness are a few that come to mind. While such values are central to Cornell, powerful voices have characterized student culture by a variety of negative terms, including ""binge drinking,"" ""sexual violence,"" and ""hazing."" Cornellians do not condone such behaviors and most students act responsibly. Indeed, understanding the concept of culture and how student leaders use it to promote commitment can go a long way toward deterring these problems and managing the minority of students who engage in such unwanted behavior. This course will teach students;"

We move from the initial ""encounters"" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the ""New World,"" the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century.

LAW 7403,"Law, Money, and Financial Macrodynamics",3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"Law constitutes money and finance, while money and finance drive the macroeconomic dynamics that bring us growth, employment, and long term wealth accumulation. Opinions have long varied, however, over just how money and finance shape macroeconomic phenomena, and thus over what legal and institutional structures are best suited to yielding financial and macroeconomic optima. This course, co-taught by a financially trained and experienced lawyer and a legally trained and experienced financier, both with backgrounds in macroeconomics, critically examines the linkages among law, money, and financial macrodynamics, as well as the thought of some leading thinkers and policymakers in these fields over the past century or so.

The seminar will examine the current law in the context of changes that have taken place in African society from colonization through the present day. Students will read cases and statutes from multiple African countries. Students will be encouraged to choose an area of law to conduct a comparative analysis in the required final paper. The seminar creates opportunities for multicultural experiences through immersion in South Africa's society and culture during a three-week winter trip to Johannesburg, South Africa, where students will receive instruction at the University of Johannesburg. (Travel assistance will be available based on demonstrated need. Please contact, Program Manager, IAD at 190 Uris Hall for more information.) The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches"

Today, some of the most heated debates surrounding feminism, identity politics, and Black women are framed within the broad contours of hip hop. This course will explore how women are portrayed in hip hop music and culture, addressing women both as consumers and producers. We will draw on texts that analyze misogyny in hip hop music and music videos, while also looking at how both mainstream and peripheral female artists use hip hop to affirm their sexual power, articulate Black feminism, and create spaces for their artistic expression. The course will utilize Black feminist theory, performance studies, and queer of color critique to complicate the ways in which women, gender, and sexuality are represented in hip hop music. While our analyses will center on music and on the United States, we will also consider art, fashion, and dance within Black, Latina, and Caribbean interactions with hip hop. The course will investigate how youth construct gender and ethnic identities as they negotiate notions of African Diasporic belonging vis-à-vis hip hop. We will employ ethnographic, historical, sociological, literary, and interdisciplinary texts to explore questions such as: What do the sexual politics of rap music reveal about Black women's conceptualizations of feminism? How can we apply early ""hip hop feminism"" to understand current debates about Beyoncé and Nicki Minaj?  How are hetero-normative gender ideologies reinforced in hip hop culture?

Comparison is an effective way to discern and assess what is unique and what is general in the distinctive form of America's capitalist democracy. In this course the liberal market economy of the United States with its distinctive strengths and weaknesses is put side-by-side with different forms of liberal, corporatist and statist market economies that characterize different European countries in the emerging European polity. The diversity of capitalism points to one overarching conclusion: all of these countries are arguably capitalist, democratic market economies belonging to ""the West;"" and each of them has distinctive strengths and weaknesses. Like all other countries, America is ordinary in mobilizing its formidable capacities and displaying its glaring weaknesses as it copes with change. "

PHIL 1440,Ethics of Eating,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(KCM-AS),,,"We all face difficult moral decisions on occasion. This course introduces students to the idea that we face such a decision several times a day in deciding what to eat. How should facts about animal life and death inform this decision? Is the suffering involved in meat, egg, and dairy production really bad enough to make the practices immoral? How do our dietary choices affect local and non-local economies, the environment, and other people generally? Finally, given the deep connections between eating practices and various ethnic, religious and class identities, how can we implement a reasonable food policy for an expanding world population while also respecting these important differences? The goal of this course is not to teach some preferred set of answers to these questions. The goal is rather to give participants the basic tools required to reflect clearly and effectively on the questions themselves. These tools include a working knowledge of the major moral theories developed by philosophers, and an understanding of basic empirical issues related to food production, distribution, consumption, and disposal.

We will then use these assessments to evaluate a number of possible positions in the ontology of mind. Is the best physicalism eliminativist, reductionist, or anti-reductionist?  Is the best anti-physicalism substance dualist, property dualist, idealist, Russellian monist, or panpsychist?  Lastly, we will consider the consequences that physicalism has for the claim that we have free will"

PMA 1130,FWS: Going Undercover: Radical Undercover Journalism and the (re)creation of Self,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"What would it be like to go through life as a completely different person? In order to expose and combat social injustice, journalists have crossed lines of race, gender, age, class and appearance and gone undercover, sometimes risking their reputations, sanity and even their lives. But what are the results of these experiments? Do the ends justify the sometimes ethically questionable means? How does ""going undercover"" affect an individual or a community? By examining works of John Howard Griffin, Sarah Jones, Morgan Spurlock, Barbara Ehrenreich, Norah Vincent and a variety of identity-probing texts, we examine the complex facets of diverse identities. The course facilitates a range of writing assignments and culminates in students devising and executing their own undercover journalism and research projects"
PMA 1131,FWS: Performing the Past/Rehearsing the Future,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"When artists engage with historical subjects, is there an obligation to represent those subjects accurately? Can dramatic interventions into history empower artists and audiences to imagine a future that diverges from our past? What are the ethical considerations involved in altering historical narratives for political or artistic purposes? Contemporary works like Lin-Manuel Miranda's Hamilton have captured the imagination of American audiences, raising significant questions about theater's ability to not only represent the facts of history, but also its ability (and perhaps responsibility) to meaningfully intervene into historical narratives. This course engages with these questions through the close analysis of dramatic texts. Through in-class discussions, direct instruction, and collaborative writing workshops, students will develop the ability to analyze scholarly arguments and produce coherent, concise, persuasive prose"
PMA 1132,FWS: Boyfriendtwin: Queer Uncanny Doppelgangers,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"Why are two identical people unsettling? ""Uncanny"" resemblances suggest the strange, even the supernatural. This course will investigate the doppelgänger myth influencing superstitions about un- or supernatural twins across the history of literature, drama, and film. We will look at a diverse selection of materials including Shakespeare, Robert Louis Stevenson, Christopher Nolan, and Joss Whedon. Considering the ways doubles work across styles from The Parent Trap to The Shining, the course concludes with an exploration of the contemporary social phenomenon of ""twinning"" in queer culture in relation to the long legacy of the double. With an emphasis on in-class discussion and peer editing, this class will foster and enhance each student's ability to produce coherent, concise, persuasive prose in the form of critical arguments"
PMA 1133,FWS: Sex Acts: American Drama 1950-Present,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"Is sex always a private matter? What constitutes sex and what happens when it is performed in public? This course asks: how does sex in theater and performance contribute to our understandings of identity, power, and community? Grounded in a study of dramatic literature and theatrical spectacles, this course discusses how representations of sex in theater and performance contribute to and challenge prevalent understandings of theater history, intimacy, and what ""good"" and ""bad"" theater is. With an emphasis on in-class discussion and peer editing, this class will foster and enhance each student's ability to produce coherent, concise, persuasive prose in the form of critical arguments. Students will analyze examples of performance through the lenses of critical texts drawn from the fields of performance studies, theatre studies, gender and sexuality studies, Black studies, and critical race theory"
PMA 1134,FWS: Poetics of Incarceration,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"The number of American prisons grows each year—with alarming ties to racism. As seen, for instance, in the HBO productions of Oz and Orange is the New Black, and events at Abu Ghraib, as well as numerous other recent and historic prison narratives, prisons (and prison metaphors and similes) drive our understanding of crime, our legitimization of U.S. citizenship, and our comprehension of racial and class identities. How can we articulate how prison performs as a social symbol? Drawing on historical and theoretical texts as well as present day media, we will explore how prison as reality and ""prison as metaphor"" permeate our thoughts, our speech, and stage, film, and literary representations. We will work to synthesize, and perhaps  shift, our individual and group perceptions of a life under siege in the shadow of the racist prison wall"

PMA 2403,Africa in Hollywood,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 2771, ENGL 2771",(LA-AS),,,"In Eddie Murphy's Coming to America, Africa is a place of nobility, where even lions are at peace with lambs. In contrast, Leonardo DeCaprio's Blood Diamond is a violent look at the role the demand for diamonds has played in destabilizing mineral-rich African countries. But if Hollywood has long been concerned with depicting Africa in particular ways, African filmmakers are at the same time creating their own stories. Popular and scholarly film critics are also contributing to the battle over who speaks for Africa. In this course we will explore these competing images of Africa, questions of imagination versus reality, and the extent to which artists should, if at all, be responsible to the subject of their art"
PMA 2493,Middle Eastern Cinema,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 2293, JWST 2793, NES 2793, VISST 2193",(LA-AS),(GB),,"Film industries in the Middle East, as in much of the rest of the world, emerged out of efforts at the national level. In the Arab world and Israel, the film industries reflect upon struggles of self-determination. The Iranian film industry underwent significant changes following the Islamic Revolution of 1979. By viewing a range of films from the Arab world, including North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean, as well as from Turkey, Israel, and Iran, we will consider the significance of these national rubrics and how they have shaped the work of filmmakers throughout the Middle East.   Films also reach beyond the boundaries of the nation, and so, we will consider how these films transcend national borders. On the one hand we will consider limit factors, like censorship, and the role of language and dialect on film viewership and distribution. And, on the other hand, we will consider the influence of external forces, such as the influence of foreign film markets in Europe and North America on filmmakers in the Middle East, as well as the effects of foreign financing—both from Europe and the Gulf States.  All films will be screened with English subtitles"

While origins and destinations often seem the most significant, modern media and cultural mobility also invite us to consider the experience of being in transit, of what happens as things move from point A to point B. This course examines the function of media in processes of mobilization and immobilization through readings in travel writing and cultural theory (e.g., Goethe, Kafka, Seghers, Simmel, Benjamin, Kracauer). Our guiding questions will include: What kinds of situations tend to create mobility or immobility? To what extent do technologies like the telegraph, telephone, and radio contribute to increased mobility and global connections?

In theology, some readings of the Hebrew Bible see skin as a barrier between human and divine; others read skin color as a sign of divine dis/favor; still others worry about wounds and other stigmata.

What role have Islamized Armenians played in this debate, and how have their narratives underscored how gender was a central aspect of the Armenian Genocide? This course addresses the specific experiences of trafficked women and children who were subjected to forced Islamization.These practices of violent erasure will be examined within the context of the late Ottoman understanding of gender and slavery, and emerging Turkish nationalism which targeted Armenians for extermination through mass murder, enslavement, and forced assimilation.Assigned course materials include an interdisciplinary mix of scholarly readings, oral histories, novels, memoirs alongside print and visual media"

Philosophers often disembody meaning, but feminist and queer theory have intersected with philosophy to insist on the importance of what is (as Jeanette Winterson writes) ""written on the body""—inscribed on and as the skin. In theology, some readings of the Hebrew Bible see skin as a barrier between human and divine; others read skin color as a sign of divine dis/favor; still others worry about wounds and other stigmata. We will look at ways that skin is ""marked"" as readable, and at modes in which this is valued or disvalued, how it stigmatizes or registers as blank"

Copernicus, who set the Earth in motion around the sun in the early 16th century, and Newton, who made the universe an infinite expanse filled with gravitational attractive forces, at the end of the 17th, frame this crucial period of European expansion. The new universe was invented at the same time as the discovery and exploitation of the New World and the establishment of new trading relationships with the East. This course, a weekly 400-level seminar, examines the new ideas and approaches to nature promoted by European philosophers and mathematicians as part of this outward-looking enterprise aimed at the practical command of the world.

In this course, we will draw on science & technology studies, technology design, and the arts to analyze the values embodied in technology design and to design technologies to promote positive social impact. What social and cultural values do technology designs consciously or unconsciously promote? To what degree can social impact be ""built into"" a technology?

How do social movements respond to niches in contentious knowledge to expand influence? To what extent is science made politically vulnerable by its commitment to incremental evidence-based knowledge in contention with junk science?
