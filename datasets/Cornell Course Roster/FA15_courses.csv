AMST 4202,The Politics of Inequality: The History of the U.S. Welfare State,4,Graded,Fall,,,HIST 4202,(HA-AS),,,"This research seminar explores how Americans and their elected leaders struggled to respond to economic and social inequality throughout the twentieth century. It traces the expansions and retractions of the U.S. welfare state with special attention to the influence of average people's organizing and activism. Among other things, students will study the Progressive Era, the New Deal, the Great Society, the ""Reagan Revolution,"" and Clinton's welfare reforms. Assessment will be on the basis of class discussion, weekly reading responses, and a substantial research paper based in primary sources"
AMST 4393,The Underground Railroad and the Coming of the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 4393, HIST 4393, HIST 6393",(HA-AS),(HB),,"In 1850 American politicians banded together cross-regionally, passed a Fugitive Slave Law and breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they had once again dodged the slavery issue that threatened disunion. This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the ""General Strike"" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion"
AMST 4412,Playing out Difference: History and Identity in Sports Film,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"FGSS 4412, PMA 4412, VISST 4412",(CA-AS),,,"The importance of sports to American society and popular culture cannot be denied, and this seminar will study sports films' vital significance in representing the intersection of sports, history, and social identities.  This seminar explores how the role of competition between individuals and teams in sports films relate to the competing discourses on race, gender, class, and sexuality in society at large. Additionally, we will examine how social issues are understood in sporting terms and concepts, such as: the hero and the underdog; urban and rural; natural talent versus hard work; and the individual versus team identity"
AMST 4505,Civil Rights Temporalities,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 4550, SHUM 4505",,,,"From court decisions about the voting rights act to legislation involving abortion, many social issues are shaped by civil rights temporalities—narratives making amorphous conceptions of ""how long,"" ""time enough,"" and progress central to discussions of rights held by identity groups. These stories linking time, identity, and rights are not only told by jurists and legislators, but by news pundits, activists, and creators of popular cultural productions. This class will look at Supreme Court decisions, theorists of temporality, and a  variety of cultural productions to explore the fictions told about identity, time, and rights in the United States"
AMST 4650,American Paranoia,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ENGL 4650,(LA-AS),,,"Following the lead of Richard Hofstadter's classic 1964 essay ""The Paranoid Style in American Politics,"" this course will examine the ""paranoid style"" in contemporary American fiction and film. The paranoias and plots we will encounter vary considerably (personal paranoias, political conspiracies, governments turned enemy, surveillance technology run amok, apocalyptic-millennial paranoia). Yet when viewed together they seem to cohere as a distinct style within post-WWII American narrative. We will ask how paranoid style responds to the contemporary American context and how the fears dominating these narratives shape their aesthetic form. Why has paranoia arisen as such a distinctively American attitude? What is the paranoid afraid of? (Should we be paranoid, too?) Novels by Nabokov, Pynchon, Reed, Dick, DeLillo, Didion, Roth; films by Coppola, Romero, Bigelow, Baldwin"
AMST 4667,Forms of the New: Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ENGL 4667,(LA-AS),(HB),,"This course gives an in-depth reading of the two greatest American poets of the nineteenth century. Some readers consider Whitman and Dickinson the two greatest American poets of any century, and one signal of that achievement is the ways in which both writers developed new kinds of poetry, opening up new possibilities for themselves and for other writers. We place both poets in the historical contexts of the nineteenth century, and we also consider the critical contexts of the century since their deaths"

AMST 4880,Contemporary Poetry and Poetics,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 4860, ENGL 4960, SPAN 4880",(LA-AS),,,"What gives contemporary poetry and poetics its resonance and value? What are its dominant features, audiences, and purposes? What does 21st-century poetry's textual environment look like, and how does it situate itself among other genres, discourses, disciplines, media? How would we describe its ambient noise and how does that noise shape, inform, inflect its particular concerns and motivated forms? How does contemporary poetry resist, engage, respond to, sound out that noise? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal cultural, economic, historical, philosophical, political developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a wide range of works that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions of personal and collective identity and language in contexts at once local and global.

This course examines the political context of the study of the past, and the uses to which accounts of the past have been put in the present. Archaeology is often implicated in nationalist claims to territory, or claims of ethnic, racial, or religious superiority. Museum exhibits and other presentations to the public always have an agenda, consciously or otherwise. Archaeologists are increasingly required to interact with descendent communities, often in the context of postcolonial tensions. The antiquities trade and the protection of archaeological sites connects archaeologists to commercial and law enforcement sectors.

This course examines a range of texts that treat the body as both subject and object of cultural, technological, political, and ethical processes. Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. We will attend to histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, and commodity.

ANTHR 4021,Studying Korea Through Gender and Sexuality,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASIAN 4421, FGSS 4121",(CA-AS),(GB),,"The course explores contemporary Korean society and culture through the issues of gender and sexuality. In the 1980s the notion of gender and sexuality began to use to problematize women's position and gender relations in Korea by the groups of women's movement and the community of women's studies. Nowadays the discourse of gender and sexuality is one of the most controversial public discourse as well as personal politics in Korean society. The issues of gender and sexuality, which include conflicts, differences and contestation of Korean people depending on generation, class, sexual identity, etc. reflect changes and complexity of Korean society. Under neoliberal regime, these issues are also framed by economy. Thus, Korea newspapers report the emergence of the generation who gives up dating, marriage and childbirth because they cannot find jobs while at the same time young people's desire and idea for romantic love is getting strengthened in relation to consumption culture. By examining diverse readings and visual materials, this course aims to understand how the issues of gender and sexuality is working as one of organizing powers of Korean society in relation to family, state, globalization, colonial/postcolonialism, popular cultures and etc"

This course examines the political context of the study of the past, and the uses to which accounts of the past have been put in the present. Archaeology is often implicated in nationalist claims to territory, or claims of ethnic, racial, or religious superiority. Museum exhibits and other presentations to the public always have an agenda, consciously or otherwise. Archaeologists are increasingly required to interact with descendent communities, often in the context of postcolonial tensions. The antiquities trade and the protection of archaeological sites connects archaeologists to commercial and law enforcement sectors. We will also consider the internal politics of the practice of archaeology in various settings, including the implications of the funding sources that support archaeological work.

Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. The production and reproduction of bodies and embodied practices have long been central to the way that power works. In this class, we will read and discuss a range of approach to the body. There is much contention over how work, politics, environment, technologies, and violence shape the body and the senses. We will debate how histories of the body are intertwined with histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism, and the webs of institution, ideas, and capital that comprise these phenomena. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, commodity, and raw material. Others will contend that serious attention to the production and reproduction of the body across different times and spaces challenge traditional notions of materiality and physicality. Because every examination of the body rests-implicitly or explicitly-in a theoretical and methodological approach to experience, we will also explore the histories of bodily senses, appetites, and capabilities. Ultimately, our inquiry into contests over and reflections on ""the body,"" as well as specific bodies, aims to open up broader anthropological questions about authority, agency, sovereignties, and material life"

And how do people use public displays of art for political purposes?  These questions will frame our investigations into ""heritage policy,"" in which the arts' power to represent identities has become the center of intense international debates and controversies.  These issues affected propaganda in Nazi Germany and Sadaam Hussein's Iraq, encouraged tourism in ""developing"" countries that comodified historic sites, led Italy to accuse major American museums of supporting the theft of valuable antiquities and sparked violent conflicts between Cambodia and Thailand.  By critiquing scholarship, films and online media, students will engage with a range of rhetorical methods for creating convincing arguments, analyzing both textual and visual sources, and better understanding their relationship to their own ""cultural heritage."""

In this course, we will dip into these multiple facets of the Dutch scene, but in critical rather than a general way, in order to assess Dutch ""technologies of vision"" in picturing and describing their world.

If art history was once understood as the study of the development of style in ""European art,"" over the past century its practitioners have attempted to embrace a ""global"" perspective and to address issues of class, ethnicity, nationality, sexual orientation, and gender. Readings will focus on historically situating methods and the implications of their cross-cultural application. Papers will encourage students to put methods into practice, realizing in the process that subject matter is not an isolated choice to which methods are applied, but something that profoundly affects the approach that the researcher brings to the writing of art history"

In addition to attending to a writer's subjectivity as it is produced through writing about others, we also consider the historical, political, and economic conditions that make travel possible. We will examine how travel writing is inflected with assumptions about the cultural values, race, class, and gender of both travelers and their domestic audience, on the one hand, and the people and places they write about, on the other.

Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics.  However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system.  Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

In the 1980s the notion of gender and sexuality began to use to problematize women's position and gender relations in Korea by the groups of women's movement and the community of women's studies. Nowadays the discourse of gender and sexuality is one of the most controversial public discourse as well as personal politics in Korean society. The issues of gender and sexuality, which include conflicts, differences and contestation of Korean people depending on generation, class, sexual identity, etc. reflect changes and complexity of Korean society. Under neoliberal regime, these issues are also framed by economy. Thus, Korea newspapers report the emergence of the generation who gives up dating, marriage and childbirth because they cannot find jobs while at the same time young people's desire and idea for romantic love is getting strengthened in relation to consumption culture.

The readings for the course are chosen from a global African perspective. This does not mean that we will not read any of the 'traditional' texts.

Therefore, we examine the differences and similarities of their histories as they evolved from plantation based colonies to independent nations. "

An introductory grounding in theories of social death will allow us to explore the racial anxiety that gave birth to the genre and trace its development throughout the hemisphere. The course seeks to broaden the genre to include novels that normally would not be considered antecedents and ultimately poses the following questions: What can the figure of the zombie teach us about our evolving relationship to race? What does the recent proliferation of zombie-related television shows, movies, books and video games say about our contemporary racial anxieties?"

Nothing but an unending series of elliptical thoughts, phrases, incomplete thoughts, fragments. Only a novel about the ""shot heard around the world,"" we might argue, could produce such a sentence. Or, rumors of such a sentence. We will read DeLillo's novel, and not only to see if this sentence actually exists. There is nothing more ideological than sport -- there is a good reason why some critics prefer to call it ""war by other means"" -- in this course we will explore the connection amongst sport, ideology and literature. We will read novels, historical memoirs, short stories and, it goes without saying, works that defy categorization, in no small measure because writing on sport often defies easy generic labeling. We will wander the globe, from cricket in the Caribbean (CLR James) to football in Latin America (Eduardo Galeano, both a novelist and author of the breathtakingly beautiful, and unclassifiable work, ""Soccer in Sun and Shadow"").There will be books about baseball (""The Boys of Summer"" will give a perspective that DeLillo does not) and a story about the peculiar genius of Roger Federer. Why, we will ask ourselves, do authors dedicate themselves so pathologically to sport? Because, as a famous football manager -- yes, we'll meet him too, his name is Bill Shankly -- once said, ""its not a matter of life or death, its much more important than that."""

Is hip hop dead, or has there been a renaissance of creativity in recent years?

This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B.

Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

Whereas for many the passage to the Americas was loaded with expectation of freedom, for Africans the passage across the Atlantic was loaded with pain, loss, and separation. The Middle Passage (referred to as the Maafa) then becomes a journey of separation, dismemberment, and dislocation. But it was also on the Middle Passage, for those who survived, that the transformation into African Diaspora peoples began.

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?"

BSOC 6460,Bodies and Bodiliness,4,Stdnt Opt,,,,"ANTHR 6465, STS 6460",,,,"This course examines a range of texts that treat the body as the subject and object of cultural, technological, political, and ethical processes. Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. The production and reproduction of bodies and embodied practices have long been central to the way that power works. In this class, we will read and discuss a range of approach to the body. There is much contention over how work, politics, environment, technologies, and violence shape the body and the senses. We will debate how histories of the body are intertwined with histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism, and the webs of institution, ideas, and capital that comprise these phenomena. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, commodity, and raw material. Others will contend that serious attention to the production and reproduction of the body across different times and spaces challenge traditional notions of materiality and physicality. Because every examination of the body rests-implicitly or explicitly-in a theoretical and methodological approach to experience, we will also explore the histories of bodily senses, appetites, and capabilities. Ultimately, our inquiry into contests over and reflections on ""the body,"" as well as specific bodies, aims to open up broader anthropological questions about authority, agency, sovereignties, and material life"

It is roughly divided into two sections. The first traces the formation and the progression of modern state and party institutions following the collapse of the Qing Dynasty in 1911, through the communist rise to power and into the Mao era (1949-1976), culminating in the period of ""opening up and reform"" (1978-present).

CAPS 3967,China Transnationalized,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASIAN 3395, GOVT 3967",(CA-AS),(GB),,"China is often thought of as being isolated from the outside world.  It is imagined as existing in historic seclusion, and, following the establishment of the People's Republic, as pursuing a path of autarky. Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics.  However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system.  Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

It does so based on the premise that what China does in Asia may not necessarily be the sole determinant of the type of security order that will prevail there, but, that it does have a profound influence on the region (and, potentially, on the global order as well). In other words, in order to gain an understanding of the state of security issues in Asia today the seminar attempts to come to terms with the evolving nature of China's foreign policy and national security strategies. The course then concentrates on the most influential academic work on China's foreign relations and national security policies that has been published since the end of the Cold War"

This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively.

We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce's canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture.

How does contemporary poetry resist, engage, respond to, sound out that noise? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal cultural, economic, historical, philosophical, political developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a wide range of works that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions of personal and collective identity and language in contexts at once local and global.

We begin by analyzing the dominant approaches to development. We wrestle with the historical context, key political economic processes and institutions, and conflicting theories and meanings that fall under the rubric of development and its modern sister, globalization. We will see that 'thinking sociologically' about development involves understanding how the meaning of places and regions are socially constructed, the power dynamics and historical dimensions of different aspects of development and globalization, and how theoretical and conceptual frameworks about development have been debated. The second half of the class focuses on alternative conceptions and contemporary issues related to development and globalization.

We begin by analyzing the dominant approaches to development. We wrestle with the historical context, key political economic processes and institutions, and conflicting theories and meanings that fall under the rubric of development and its modern sister, globalization. We will see that 'thinking sociologically' about development involves understanding how the meaning of places and regions are socially constructed, the power dynamics and historical dimensions of different aspects of development and globalization, and how theoretical and conceptual frameworks about development have been debated. The second half of the class focuses on alternative conceptions and contemporary issues related to development and globalization.

We then move to models of incomplete markets where agents can only save via single risk-free bond and are only able to borrow up to a pre-determined debt limit. We characterize the decision problem faced by the individual; describe the stationary equilibrium; and then study the incomplete markets model with aggregate risk (i.e., business cycles). We will relate the calibration and predictions of these models to findings from popular survey data sets, such as the PSID and the CEX.

ENGL 1134,FWS: True Stories,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"When students write personal essays for college applications, they often discover how challenging it can be to write about themselves. In this course, we'll examine how well-known authors such as Maxine Hong Kingston, Alison Bechdel, Tim O'Brien, and others construct their public, written selves. We'll also consider how the style of writing affects how readers understand an author's personality and motives. Readings will include short essays, possible some poems, and a few longer works. Through the writing frequent essays, we'll explore why and how people write about themselves—for self-exploration, political or social change, purely to practice a form of art, or for other reasons—and we'll investigate how writing shapes lived experience"
ENGL 1147,FWS: Mystery in the Story,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"What makes a story, and what makes it a mystery story? In this course, we'll study and write about the nature of narratives, taking the classic mystery tale written by such writers as Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie, and Raymond Chandler as typical of intricately plotted stories of suspense and disclosure that have been written and filmed in many genres: Greek tragedy, horror tales by Poe and Shirley Jackson, psychological thrillers by Ruth Rendell and Patricia Highsmith, neo-noir films such as Memento and Fight Club, and postmodern mystery parodies such as those of Paul Auster and Jorge Luis Borges.

ENGL 1167,FWS: Great New Books,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"Would you be able to identify the Shakespeare or Austen of your time?  What are the best books being written today and how do we know they are great?

ENGL 1168,FWS: Cultural Studies,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"From TV news to rock lyrics, from ads to political speeches to productions of Shakespeare, the forms of culture surround us at every moment. In addition to entertaining us or enticing us, they carry implied messages about who we are, what world we live in, and what we should value.

ENGL 1170,FWS: Short Stories,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"What is the difference between an anecdote and a short story or a memoir and a short story? How does the short story separate itself from the prose poem, the myth, or the parable? What can a short story do that no other art form can do, including cinematic narrative? This course will focus on the reading and analysis of short stories derived from a range of cultures and time periods, with some emphasis on English-language stories, particularly those from the North American continent. Writers may include but not be limited to: Tobias Wolff, Alice Munro, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe, Nikolai Gogol, Eudora Welty, Louise Erdrich, Haruki Murakami, Denis Johnson, Margaret Atwood, Flannery O'Connor, Joyce Carol Oates and Anton Chekhov"
ENGL 1183,FWS: Word and Image,3,Graded,"Fall, spring",,,,,,,"Writers and artists from Homer to Raymond Pettibon have been fascinated by the relationship between words and images, a relationship that is sometimes imagined as a competition, sometimes as a collaboration. What are the differences between literary and visual media? What can the juxtaposition of word and image teach us about the nature of representation? What other kinds of ends (satiric, esoteric, etc.) do artists and writers hope to achieve by coupling words with images? To explore these questions, we will consult works drawn from a range of periods and genres (for example, graphic novels, medieval manuscripts, contemporary art and new media, emblem books, film, literary gaming, fiction and poetry). The course is structured around a progressive set of writing assignments and will include both informal exercises as well as formal essays"

By engaging in discussions and working with varied writing assignments, students will explore major modes and genres of English poetry and prose, and may learn about versification techniques, rhetorical strategies, performance as interpretation, and thematic and topical concerns. In the process students will expand the possibilities of their own writing. Sections that invite students to study and write critically about plays or films in a variety of dramatic idioms and cultural traditions may require attendance at screenings or at live productions by the theatre department"
ENGL 2010,"Dragons, Green Knights and the Origins of English Literature",3-4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"How did England, once a backwater, create some of the culture that now dominates our world? Who wrote the first poem in English, and why did Londoners believe that they were descended from exiled Trojan warriors? This course introduces you to the works that make up the foundation of what we came to call English literature, and teaches you how to read them well. Along the way, you will learn how to talk about literary works like an English major, whether you plan to be one or not. Readings include Beowulf, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, selections from Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, some of the first plays written in England as well as Shakespeare's King Lear, Elizabethan sonnets, poems by Donne, Marvell, and Herbert, and a selection from Milton's Paradise Lost"
ENGL 2030,Introduction to American Literatures: Beginnings to the Civil War,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 2030,(LA-AS),(HB),,"From a ""brave new world"" in European settlers' eyes to a ""house divided"" by the mid- nineteenth century, ""America"" is seen in an assemblage of richly layered tales, poems, novels, essays, first-hand accounts, and other documents of astonishing power and strangeness, produced in or around what became the United States. In these works, trials of persecution vie with utopian schemes, prophetic fantasies run up against exploitative hoaxes, and haunted houses are as likely to be riven with family secrets as with national hatreds. Expect to encounter tough-minded thinkers, to read closely and with curiosity, to write skeptically and carefully, and to engage in informed conversation about figures such as Bradstreet, Taylor, Wheatley, Franklin, Irving, Poe, Hawthorne, Alcott, Emerson, Thoreau, Jacobs, Dickinson, Douglass, and Melville"
ENGL 2045,Major Poets,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Readings from the work of nine poets chosen to help us think about the nature and possibilities of poetry and different ways of engaging with it: Shakespeare (the sonnets), Alexander Pope, John Keats, Emily Dickinson, Walt Whitman, Gerard Manley Hopkins, Robert Frost, W. H. Auden, and A. R. Ammons. One assumption of the course is that there are other things to do with poems besides interpret them: reading aloud, writing imitations or parodies, memorizing, identifying poetic techniques, and creating anthologies of favorite poems. No previous study of poetry is presumed"
ENGL 2050,Contemporary World Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(GB),,"This course examines contemporary world literature from the second half of the twentieth century to the present. Our readings will range across genres (including fiction, poetry, and drama) and include writers from multiple geographies-in addition to America and Britain, South Asia, Africa, the Middle East, and the Caribbean. As we define the category ""world literature,"" we will explore innovations in aesthetics as well as historical developments that have influenced recent literary production. In particular, our readings will compel us to investigate how ethnicity, nationalism, religion, gender, and economics have impacted the formation of world literature and its bearings on social justice. Authors may include: O'Neill, DeLillo, Plath, Kushner, Coetzee, Walcott, Danticat, and McCann"
ENGL 2730,Children's Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"An historical study of children's literature from the 17th century to the present, principally in Europe and America, which will explore changing literary forms in relation to the social history of childhood. Ranging from oral folktale to contemporary novelistic realism (with some glances at film narrative), major figures may include Perrault, Newbery, the Grimms, Andersen, Carroll, Alcott, Stevenson, Burnett, Kipling, the Disney studio, E. B. White, C. S. Lewis, Sendak, Silverstein, Mildred Taylor, and Bette Greene. We'll also encounter a variety of critical models—psychoanalytic, materialist, feminist, structuralist—that scholars have employed to explain the variety and importance of children's literature. Finally, we will consider how the idea of ""the child"" has evolved over this period"
ENGL 2740,Scottish Literature,3-4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,MEDVL 2740,(LA-AS),(HB),,"Although Scotland, which was long a separate nation, is now politically united with England, it preserves its distinctiveness. This course provides an introduction to Scottish literature, with special emphasis on the medieval period and the 18th through the 20th centuries. The course should appeal to those who wish to learn about their Scottish heritage, and also to those who simply wish to encounter a remarkable national culture and the literature it has produced. Some of the texts will be read in Scots, but no familiarity with Scots or earlier English is presumed. We welcome readers of literature who are not English majors"
ENGL 2751,"Literature, Sport, and Ideology",3,Graded,Fall,,,ASRC 2505,(LA-AS),,,"There is, the apochryphal story goes, a sentence that is 65 pages long in Don DeLillo's novel ""Underworld."" Nothing but an unending series of elliptical thoughts, phrases, incomplete thoughts, fragments. Only a novel about the ""shot heard around the world,"" we might argue, could produce such a sentence. Or, rumors of such a sentence. We will read DeLillo's novel, and not only to see if this sentence actually exists. There is nothing more ideological than sport -- there is a good reason why some critics prefer to call it ""war by other means"" -- in this course we will explore the connection amongst sport, ideology and literature. We will read novels, historical memoirs, short stories and, it goes without saying, works that defy categorization, in no small measure because writing on sport often defies easy generic labeling. We will wander the globe, from cricket in the Caribbean (CLR James) to football in Latin America (Eduardo Galeano, both a novelist and author of the breathtakingly beautiful, and unclassifiable work, ""Soccer in Sun and Shadow"").There will be books about baseball (""The Boys of Summer"" will give a perspective that DeLillo does not) and a story about the peculiar genius of Roger Federer. Why, we will ask ourselves, do authors dedicate themselves so pathologically to sport? Because, as a famous football manager -- yes, we'll meet him too, his name is Bill Shankly -- once said, ""its not a matter of life or death, its much more important than that."""
ENGL 2790,Lit! Literature and Intoxication,4,Graded,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course explores ways that literature is a form of intoxication. Poetry and fiction have long been condemned for luring readers into decadence. Consider the Republic: Socrates bans poetry from his state. ""Under the excitement of poetry,"" Socrates argues, citizens ""neglect justice and virtue."" Yet proponents celebrate imaginative writing for its mind-altering properties. A good novel is said to change one's thinking and even impart transcendence. In a letter, Emily Dickinson describes a potent buzz: ""If I feel physically as if the top of my head were taken off, I know that is poetry."" We'll read widely and closely to sample diverse literary highs and methods. We'll also consider humanity's complex relationship with intoxication and recent trends on college campuses"
ENGL 2800,Introduction to Creative Writing,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,completion of the First-Year Writing Seminar requirement,,,(LA-AS),,,"An introductory course in the theory, practice, and reading of fiction, poetry, and allied forms.

Some class meetings may feature peer review of student work, and instructors may assign writing exercises or prompts"
ENGL 2880,Expository Writing,4,Stdnt Opt,"Fall, winter",,,,(LA-AS),,,"This course does not satisfy requirements for the English major. ENGL 2880 offers guidance and an audience for students who wish to gain skill in expository writing—a common term for critical, reflective, investigative, and creative nonfiction. Each section provides a context for writing defined by a form of exposition, a disciplinary area, a practice, or a topic intimately related to the written medium. Course members will read in relevant published material and write and revise their own work regularly, while reviewing and responding to one another's. Since these seminar-sized courses depend on members' full participation, regular attendance and submission of written work are required. Students and instructors will confer individually throughout the term"
ENGL 2910,It's All Chinese to Me,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AAS 2910, AMST 2910",(CA-AS),,,"In her memoir Woman Warrior, Maxine Hong Kingston identified a conundrum familiar to many US-born children of Chinese immigrants when she asked: ""What is Chinese tradition and what is the movies?"" What is ""Chinese tradition""? Does it mean the same thing to people in China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore, or to Chinese diasporic communities in North America?  Does ""Chineseness"" change across time and space? While there will be occasion to discuss what ""Chineseness"" means in different Asian contexts, this course will focus primarily on how ideas of ""China"" and ""Chineseness"" have been historically constructed by, for, and in the West—particularly in the US. Course materials include readings on the concept of ""Chineseness,"" Chinese American literature and film, and historical studies of East/West relations"
ENGL 2931,Race and the Zombie Apocalypse,4,Graded,,,,"AMST 2310, ASRC 2310",,,,"This course takes a critical approach to our contemporary understanding of the figure of the zombie and its inextricable link to discourses on race and blackness in the Americas. An introductory grounding in theories of social death will allow us to explore the racial anxiety that gave birth to the genre and trace its development throughout the hemisphere. The course seeks to broaden the genre to include novels that normally would not be considered antecedents and ultimately poses the following questions: What can the figure of the zombie teach us about our evolving relationship to race? What does the recent proliferation of zombie-related television shows, movies, books and video games say about our contemporary racial anxieties?"
ENGL 3021,Literary Theory on the Edge,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,COML 3021,(LA-AS),,,"This course introduces the most exciting and cutting-edge theoretical advances of the 20th and 21st centuries. Taught by two Cornell professors active in the field, along with occasional invited guests, lectures will cover such movements as structuralism, deconstruction, trauma theory, biopolitics, human-animal studies and post-human studies. The distinctiveness of literature and the power and complexity of language in all its forms will remain a central focus in the course. Course open to all levels; no previous knowledge of theory required"
ENGL 3110,Old English,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ENGL 6110, MEDVL 3110, MEDVL 6110",(LA-AS),(HB),,"In this course, we will read and discuss some of the earliest surviving English poetry and prose. Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records. We will begin by reading some easy prose and will go on to consider some more challenging heroic, elegiac, and devotional poetry, including an excerpt from the masterpiece Beowulf. The course may also be used as preparation for the sequence ENGL 3120/ENGL 6120"
ENGL 3300,"Satire, Sensibility, and Sexuality in 18th Century Literature",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"""To my mind, the two most fascinating subjects in the universe are sex and the eighteenth century.""–Brigid Brophy. Close reading of texts in a variety of genres (poetry, fiction, drama, philosophy, autobiography, essay) will be guided by such topics as: the nature of satire, irony, and mock-forms; the politics of gender and sexuality; the authority and fallibility of human knowledge; the rhetoric of eighteenth-century verse forms; the aesthetics of the sublime and the beautiful; the Enlightenment as an intellectual movement. Works by such writers as Rochester, Behn, Dryden, Wycherley, Swift, Pope, Cleland, Johnson, Boswell, Sterne, Kant, and Cowper"
ENGL 3390,Jane Austen,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a student who has read Jane Austen must be in want of excuses to continue that delicious experience. This course explores Austen's characters, culture, and narrative art against the backdrop of films, novels, and poems which resonate with her fiction. We will investigate Austen's importance in literary history and her continuing attraction in the twenty-first century. By immersing ourselves in her fictional world we will enrich our experience of her novels and sharpen our awareness of the pleasures of reading"
ENGL 3400,British Romanticism,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),(HB),,"With the exhilarating and terrifying historical ""experiments"" of the French and American Revolutions in the background, English Romantic writers tackled the question of the personal and political effects of literary experimentation. They did so in dialogue with new methods of experimental science that were unsettling traditional conceptions of thinking, feeling, nature and social progress. Could new literary techniques have revolutionary or reactionary effects, or elude the very logic of cause and effect? Might poems and novels alter routines of perception or harbor lost histories and futures? Such possibilities for ""experiment"" will guide this survey of Romantic literature, from poetic neuroscience to the Revolution controversy and experimental writing from Blake, the Shelleys, Wordsworth, Coleridge, Burke, Goethe, Baillie and Barbauld"
ENGL 3500,The High Modernist Tradition,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Critical study of major works by Joyce, Woolf, Conrad, Forster, Lawrence, Eliot, Yeats, Wilde, Hardy, Hopkins, and others, all of whom are indispensable for understanding subsequent literature. The emphasis will be on close reading of individual texts. We shall place the authors and works within the context of literary, political, cultural, and intellectual history. The course will seek to define the development of literary modernism (mostly but not exclusively in England), and relate literary modernism in England to that in Europe and America as well as to other intellectual developments. We shall be especially interested in the relationship between modern literature and modern painting and sculpture; on occasion, we shall look at slides. Within the course material, students will be able to select the topics on which they write essays"
ENGL 3580,Twentieth Century Women Writers of Color in the Americas,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AAS 3580, AMST 3580, FGSS 3581",(LA-AS),,,"In this course, we'll be reading literature—primarily novels—produced by hemispheric American women writers of the mid- to late twentieth-century.  We will look at how these writings articulate concerns with language, home, mobility, and memory, and at how the work is informed by the specificities of gender, race, region, and class.  Readings may include work by Leslie Marmon Silko, Sandra Cisneros, Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Jamaica Kincaid, Gwendolyn Brooks, Ann Petry, Fae Myenne Ng, Carolivia Herron, Helena Maria Viramontes, and Shani Mootoo"

ENGL 3710,Literature of the Outlaw,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"AMST 3710, COML 3730",(LA-AS),(GHB),,"The course draws on the world's storehouse of writing, song, and film about bandits, pirates, malingerers, revolutionary appropriators, and other defectors from the sacral order of property. Loyalty and betrayal will concern us, as will the melancholy relationship of outlawry and the passing of historical eras.  Aesthetics, ethics, and political economy will guide our enquiries. We'll study several tellings of the legend of Robin Hood, as well as Kleist, Michael Kohlhaas; Kemal, Memed, My Hawk; Genet, The Thief's Journal; Akutagawa, ""Rashomon"" and ""In a Grove""; Kurosawa, Seven Samurai;  Americo Paredes, With His Pistol in His Hand ; narcocorridos; the Jamaican film The Harder They Come; and Jim Jarmusch's film Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai.  Students will have the opportunity to develop one essay around an outlaw figure of their choice.  All readings in English"
ENGL 3747,The Trouble with Crime Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"Where would crime fiction be without its constitutive trouble—the corpse on the floor, the predatory femme fatale, the city steeped in corruption that only an honest sleuth can purge? And where would literary and filmic culture be without crime fiction to make trouble with—to parody, reinvent, complicate, and rejoice in? This course will review classic mystery story design in such writers as Poe, Doyle, Christie, and Hammett, and will read later fictions by such writers as Jorge Luis Borges, Thomas Pynchon, Patricia Highsmith, Michael Chabon, Sara Paretsky, China Miéville, Italo Calvino, and Mukoma Wa Ngugi, viewing films by John Huston, Roman Polanski, and Paul Thomas Anderson—and promising never to let the trouble go away"
ENGL 3765,The 21st Century Novel,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(LA-AS),,,"What innovations in form, style, genre, and subject matter have characterized the novel in the 21st century? What is the status of the novel in the wake of postmodernism, postcolonialism, poststructuralism, post-humanism, and the other ""post""'s of literary theory? Are we witnessing a blurring of theory and fiction? This course will explore a number of key developments and trends in the 21st century novel, such as the rise of genre fiction (fantasy, science fiction, the Western, the ""rock novel""), speculative fiction, new historical realisms, comic/graphic novels, philosophical fiction, among others trends.

Or to put it differently, how have different generations of African writers dealt with questions of sex, violence, language and power? The goal of the seminar is to increase appreciation and understanding of African literature and literature in general, while at the same time sharpening analytical, critical, oral and written skills. Students will be expected to lead discussions, engage in peer critiques and, through scholarly essays, engage African literary criticism"

Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European political and aesthetic theory. Often known simply as ""Critical Theory,"" their key works cover a vast array of intellectual, political, economic, and artistic concerns, from the dialectic of enlightenment to commentaries on popular culture, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society.

The medieval period invented shocking fictions about Jews—that they killed and ate Christian babies; that they desecrated the Host; that they were the murderers of Christ. In manuscripts Jews were visually compared to beasts, devils, and perverts. By law, Jews were forced to live in ghettos, wear distinctive dress, abstain from certain professions, and suffer exile. Beginning with Shakespeare's Shylock, we will work our way back through visual and literary treatments of Jews in the Middle Ages, reading texts by Chaucer, chronicles, miracle stories, crusader romances, and mystery plays. Drawing on recent theories of the other we will also consider how medieval representations of Jews and other minorities were used to construct medieval communal, religious, and political identities"

In this course we will interrogate the rich literature and art of the period to see how various cultures adapted to the anomaly of female rule. We will also look at the conversations the women rulers held among themselves as to their shared predicaments, aiming to revise the story of simple sexual jealousy between Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth Tudor by adding the important interlocutor, Catherine de Médicis, unofficial ruler of France. We will also look at the proto-republican political theory that gathered force during the latter half of the 16th century, which the queens found it necessary to contest"
ENGL 4291,American Shakespeare,4,Graded,,,,,,,,"What is distinctive about American Shakespeare? Is it merely a less confident cousin of its more prestigious UK relative; or does it have a character of its own? What is currently happening with 'American Shakespeare' that is not happening anywhere else? This course is designed explicitly to exploit the wide variety of human and material resources of the DC and surrounding area, such as the Folger Shakespeare Library and Theatre, the Shakespeare Theatre and the Blackfriars Playhouse at Staunton.

Le Guin, Jhumpa Lahiri, Sandra Cisneros, Gish Jen, Julie Schumacher, Tobias Wolff, Junot Díaz, Hannah Tinti, and Martin Pousson.

The paranoias and plots we will encounter vary considerably (personal paranoias, political conspiracies, governments turned enemy, surveillance technology run amok, apocalyptic-millennial paranoia). Yet when viewed together they seem to cohere as a distinct style within post-WWII American narrative. We will ask how paranoid style responds to the contemporary American context and how the fears dominating these narratives shape their aesthetic form. Why has paranoia arisen as such a distinctively American attitude? What is the paranoid afraid of? (Should we be paranoid, too?) Novels by Nabokov, Pynchon, Reed, Dick, DeLillo, Didion, Roth; films by Coppola, Romero, Bigelow, Baldwin"
ENGL 4667,Forms of the New: Walt Whitman and Emily Dickinson,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 4667,(LA-AS),(HB),,"This course gives an in-depth reading of the two greatest American poets of the nineteenth century.

We shall place Ulysses in the context of Joyce's canon, Irish culture, and literary modernism. We shall explore the relationship between Ulysses and other experiments in modernism-especially painting and sculpture-and show how Ulysses redefines the concepts of epic, hero, and reader. We shall examine Ulysses as a political novel-specifically, Joyce's response to Yeats and the Celtic Renaissance; Joyce's role in the debate about the direction of Irish politics after Parnell; and Joyce's response to British colonial occupation of Ireland. We shall also consider Ulysses as an urban novel in which Bloom, the marginalized Jew and outsider, is symptomatic of the kind of alienation created by urban culture.

What are its dominant features, audiences, and purposes? What does 21st-century poetry's textual environment look like, and how does it situate itself among other genres, discourses, disciplines, media? How would we describe its ambient noise and how does that noise shape, inform, inflect its particular concerns and motivated forms? How does contemporary poetry resist, engage, respond to, sound out that noise? How are we to understand its relation to the pivotal cultural, economic, historical, philosophical, political developments of our time? This seminar will explore these and related questions in a wide range of works that open onto the rich interplay of contemporary poetry and poetics with questions of personal and collective identity and language in contexts at once local and global.

As we focus on African artists and theorists, we also read American and European theorists, including but not certainly limited to Giorgio Agamben, Michel Foucault, Roland Barthes, and Joseph Slaughter, detecting the ways in which discourses around bodies in the African context may shape contemporary theories and vice versa"

Attention will be paid to (1) learning to read the language in which this literature is written, (2) evaluating the poetry as poetry: its form, structure, style, and varieties of meaning, and (3) seeing what can be learned about the culture of Anglo-Saxon England and about the early Germanic world in general, from an examination of the Old English literary records.

We will explore the relationship between the spontaneous, original, and authentic, and the mechanical, replicated, and performative. Writers may include: Rochester, Dryden, Wycherley, Swift, Pope, Fielding, Cleland, Mackenzie, Sterne, Hume, La Mettrie, Johnson, Kant, and Burke. Readings by critics and theorists such as Horkheimer, Adorno, Cassirer, Benjamin, Kenner, Foucault, Roach, Bhabha, and others.

ENGL 6455,Romanticism and the Life of Things,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"""Up to the end of the eighteenth century, life does not exist,"" writes Michel Foucault in The Order of Things. The provocation means not that life on Earth began at 1800, but rather that only then do living things start to cut a unique profile in the history of human knowledge, motivating a dedicated science (biology) and new theories of nature, labor and language. This course will focus on the problem of life and the rhetoric of animation in the poetry, prose, and theory of Romanticism – asking not least how literary techniques of ""becoming-thing"" challenge the culture of life by hewing close to the commodity, the ruin, the rock, and the slave. Mostly English and German literature, with readings in rhetoric, biopolitics, ecocriticism, and materialism"
ENGL 6511,The African Diaspora: Theories and Texts,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,ASRC 6511,,,,"The Middle Passage is perhaps the most evocative and simultaneously the most painful of transitions any people have made. Whereas for many the passage to the Americas was loaded with expectation of freedom, for Africans the passage across the Atlantic was loaded with pain, loss, and separation. The Middle Passage (referred to as the Maafa) then becomes a journey of separation, dismemberment, and dislocation. But it was also on the Middle Passage, for those who survived, that the transformation into African Diaspora peoples began. This course examines a range of middle passage texts such as novels, poetry, film, drama, slave narratives, and historical texts in order to explore comparatively how artists from across the African Diaspora have approached this historically and emotionally loaded event"
ENGL 6535,"Literature and the State: Spies, Diplomats, Bureaucrats",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"This class will survey 20th century writers who simultaneously worked in the service of state information networks as spies and civil servants. How might participation in cultural-political institutions of the Cold War have conditioned late modernism both ideologically and formally? We will assess key genres of the period—spy novel, campus novel, structuralist code-work, memoir of state service—and see what writers did when modernist tropes of cross-cultural contact become the mediated province of state offices in the mid-century.

Fiction and poetry will include selections from the work of Julio de Burgos, Rafael Campo, José Marti, Rafael Serra, Pedro Pietri, Junot Diaz, Julia Alvarez, Giannina Braschi, Oscar Hijuelos, and Sonia Rivera-Valdés.

ENGL 6751,Feminist Theory,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,FGSS 6751,,,,"How might we define feminist theory at this moment? This course will analyze some of the key concepts and controversies that have shaped contemporary articulations of feminist discourse. These concepts include embodiment, affect, desire, space, pleasure, memory, and agency; they cut across and inform the realms of transnational feminism, queer theory, cultural studies, women of color feminism, and children's rights. We will bring some concreteness to this wide-ranging field by considering theory in relation to particular situations; for example, we might look at ""desire"" in relation to pornography and media studies, or ""transnationalism"" in relation to the murders of women along the U.S.-Mexico border. Assignments will focus on how students can use feminist theory as a lens through which to formulate their own academic projects"
ENGL 6774,Queer Time in Contemporary Fiction,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"What might it mean to queer time, and why might a fiction writer want to do so? In this seminar we will address these questions, reading both theory and fiction to explore the relationships among sexuality, time, and narrative form. We will track queer temporality both at the level of the stories authors tell and at the level of the formal strategies and structures they use to tell them and will ask what sorts of queer world-making possibilities are produced from these uses of queer time. We will begin by tracking the debate between the Utopian and the Antisocial strains of queer theory's work on temporality, reading such theorists as José Esteban Muñoz, Elizabeth Freeman, Lee Edelman, Judith Halberstam, and others; we will also consider work emerging from queer literary theory. Fiction under consideration may include texts by Alison Bechdel, Marusya Bociurkiw, Carol Rifka Brunt, Tony Kushner, Mia McKenzie, Achy Obejas, Monique Truong, and Craig Womack"
ENGL 6912,Michel Foucault: Sovereignty to BioPolitics,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 6212, GOVT 6215",,,,"This course will explore the ways in which Michel Foucault's oeuvre transitions from a concern with sovereignty to a preoccupation with biopolitics. Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

FGSS 4000,"Senior Seminar in Feminist, Gender, and Sexuality Studies",4,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"In this seminar, we will focus on the intersection of gender, sexuality, and human rights. Although issues of gender and sexuality have always been integral to human rights, in the last 40 years, they have become an increasingly articulated component of human rights activism, law, and policy making. This gendering of the international human rights agenda has run parallel to the growing institutionalization of feminist, gender, and sexuality studies in the academy. We explore this convergence between human rights theory and its practice in order to think about how feminist scholarship both emerges from and informs everyday lives around the world, especially those of women and sexual minorities. Within this rather broad rubric, we will consider various case studies and use these as examples for student research papers; these case studies will focus on central figures in human rights discourse—children, sex workers, garment workers, migrant agricultural labor, and transnational athletes. Throughout the semester, we will also consider how this course and others in FGSS prepare one to pursue jobs in human rights organizations and other advocacy fields.  This senior seminar is only open to, and is required by, Feminist, Gender, & Sexuality Studies majors"
FGSS 4121,Studying Korea Through Gender and Sexuality,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ANTHR 4021, ASIAN 4421",(CA-AS),(GB),,"The course explores contemporary Korean society and culture through the issues of gender and sexuality. In the 1980s the notion of gender and sexuality began to use to problematize women's position and gender relations in Korea by the groups of women's movement and the community of women's studies. Nowadays the discourse of gender and sexuality is one of the most controversial public discourse as well as personal politics in Korean society. The issues of gender and sexuality, which include conflicts, differences and contestation of Korean people depending on generation, class, sexual identity, etc. reflect changes and complexity of Korean society. Under neoliberal regime, these issues are also framed by economy. Thus, Korea newspapers report the emergence of the generation who gives up dating, marriage and childbirth because they cannot find jobs while at the same time young people's desire and idea for romantic love is getting strengthened in relation to consumption culture. By examining diverse readings and visual materials, this course aims to understand how the issues of gender and sexuality is working as one of organizing powers of Korean society in relation to family, state, globalization, colonial/postcolonialism, popular cultures and etc"

We will bring some concreteness to this wide-ranging field by considering theory in relation to particular situations; for example, we might look at ""desire"" in relation to pornography and media studies, or ""transnationalism"" in relation to the murders of women along the U.S.-Mexico border.

GERST 1109,FWS: From Fairy Tales to the Uncanny: Exploring the Romantic Consciousness,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"How did bawdy tales of peasants using magic to climb the social ladder get transformed into moral lessons for children?  The answer lies in Romanticism and its appropriation of the imagination as a force for social transformation.  As Romantics edited older tales for juvenile consumption they wrote new ones for adults.  This new fiction created the matrix for modern pop genres like fantasy, science-fiction, murder mysteries, and gothic horror.  To understand this paradigm shift in modern culture, we will read, discuss, and write about a variety of texts the Romantics collected, composed, or inspired, including poetry and film, in addition to classic fairy tales and academic scholarship on the topic"
GERST 1112,FWS: Music and Letters,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"Homer's epics make no mention of music, because to the earliest European poets it was an integral and therefore not distinct part of their performance.

Modern literature attempts to make sense of music and uses music to approach the senseless. This course addresses 1) music as poetic device and 2) music as theme in German literature since 1800. Exploring these issues, we will work on developing arguments in critical writing. Readings may include Hölderlin, Hoffmann, Kleist, Nietzsche, Rilke, Mann, Bernhard, and Jelinek.

Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European political and aesthetic theory. Often known simply as ""Critical Theory,"" their key works cover a vast array of intellectual, political, economic, and artistic concerns, from the dialectic of enlightenment to commentaries on popular culture, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society.

Do you want to learn how to write a long research paper? Do you not want to take a final examination? If so this course may be for you. We are told that American primacy is in decline and that other powers are rising.  What do these two views entail specifically? This course seeks answers to these and other questions by examining a range of rising powers (China, India, Russia/Ukraine and Japan)  and persisting issues (finance, foreign investment, oil, trade and aid) as they play themselves out in different countries (Malaysia, North Korea, Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico, Brazil, Uganda).   "

Established in 1920s at the Institute for Social Research, the assorted circle of scholars comprising the Frankfurt School played a pivotal role in the intellectual developments of post-war American and European political and aesthetic theory. Often known simply as ""Critical Theory,"" their key works cover a vast array of intellectual, political, economic, and artistic concerns, from the dialectic of enlightenment to commentaries on popular culture, high art, commodity fetishism, and mass society. This introduction to the programmatic statements and eclectic reflections of various scholars will highlight the diverse historical influences, collaborative efforts, and internecine debates that shaped the intellectual tradition across continents and generations"
GOVT 3655,Politics and Literature,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,AMST 3655,(LA-AS),,,"What is political authority and how is it constituted? How do we judge and act when torn by conflicting obligations? How do political actors in the present negotiate the legacies of past injustice (for example, slavery, colonialism, state violence)? To what extent does the past shape and determine our political present (our sense of self, our relations with others)?  And where might we find the cultural resources for resistance and/or political transformation? These are some of the ethical and political questions we will pursue in this course through the study of prominent (and diverse) works of literature. The course will examine the important contributions of literature to the study of politics, and to the formation of a more thoughtful, critical citizenship"

Beginning with a study of the theory and practice of democratic rule in ancient Athens, we will explore continuities and innovations in democratic thinking in the revolutionary context of the Enlightenment, nineteenth-century social theory, and postcolonial responses to the consequences of the global hegemony of representational democracy in the twentieth century. Topics and themes we will consider include the value of democracy, the nature of equality, the duties and virtues of citizenship, the role of rhetoric and persuasion in democratic politics, the relationship between sovereignty and representation, and the politics of revolution. Lectures will be organized around both historical context and close reading of texts"

Recently a great deal of attention has been paid to political tensions between the Obama administration and the Netanyahu led Israeli government, yet there is a long history of American policy makers, realist and idealist, Republican and Democratic alike, clashing with their Israeli counterparts. So too, American interests in the region, particularly the US close alliance with Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt and Jordan have undergone various transformations over the past two generations. In our discussions of secondary readings and primary sources we will interrogate the stable and variable nature of US engagement with the Arab-Israeli conflict, including efforts in conflict solving and conflict management. "
GOVT 3867,The Causes of War,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course surveys leading theories of the causes of interstate war-that is, large-scale organized violence between the armed forces of states. Why is war a recurring feature of international politics? Are democracies more peaceful than other types of states, and if so what explains this ""democratic peace?"" Why do democratic publics seem to reward threats to use force by ""rallying around the flag"" in support of their governments? Does the inexorable pattern of the rise and fall of nations lead to cycles of great power wars throughout history? These and other questions will be examined in our survey of theories of war at three levels of analysis: the individual and small groups, domestic politics, and the international system. Topics include (1) theoretical explanations for war; (2) evaluation of the evidence for the various explanations; (3) the impact of nuclear weapons on international politics; (4) ethics and warfare; (5) the uses and limitations of air power"
GOVT 3877,Nuclear Security in a Changing World,4,Graded,Fall,,,,(SBA-AS),,,"This course addresses contemporary issues of nuclear security. While it reflects on the past, it focuses on the present and future: what are the current proliferation challenges? What are the threats of nuclear terrorism? Why do states develop nuclear weapons and what types of negotiation strategies can prevent nuclearization?  Have recent efforts to expand the nonproliferation regime been successful and if not, why not? The goal of the course will be to understand where nuclear security issues stand in a post-Cold War context and where they are going.  Towards this end, the course will employ innovative approaches to the study of nuclear security: real-world simulations, social media, and spatial analysis"
GOVT 3967,China Transnationalized,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASIAN 3395, CAPS 3967",(CA-AS),(GB),,"China is often thought of as being isolated from the outside world.  It is imagined as existing in historic seclusion, and, following the establishment of the People's Republic, as pursuing a path of autarky. Such separation has then only been somewhat modified by the set of economic reforms that Deng Xiaoping first instituted in the late 1970s.  In this lecture we will seek to turn such conventional wisdom on its head through examining the role that transnational actors have played in shaping the course of modern Chinese politics.  However, the course's primary focus will not be upon the past, but rather the present.  More specifically, it will concentrate on the recent rise of a new class of Chinese transnational public intellectuals who have recently risen to prominence within the PRC.  It will also seek to identify the influence such individuals are having upon not only their fields of expertise, but also upon broader Chinese debates about collective identity and the country's place in a rapidly changing international system.  Coming to terms with such issues will provide those who enroll in the class with a deeper, more nuanced, understanding of China's rise and this trend's implications for the rest of the world. We will accomplish this task through a combination of surveying the existing literature on China and transnational politics, and considering new theoretical perspectives on both.   "

We will investigate the various stable and shifting elements in the evolution of the conflict including conflicting Israeli and Palestinian narratives and mythologies about the nature of the conflict. Among many issues to be addressed are: the relationship of this conflict to the history of European colonialism in the Middle East, the emergence of Pan-Arabism and Islamism, the various currents in Zionism and its relationship to Judaism, the implication of great power rivalry in the Middle East, the different causes and political repercussions of the four Arab-Israeli wars, efforts at peacemaking including Oslo and Camp David, and the significance of the two Palestinian uprisings"

GOVT 4019,Introductory Probability and Applied Statistics,4,Graded,Fall,,,GOVT 6019,(SBA-AS),,,"The goal of this course is to introduce probability and statistics as fundamental building blocks for quantitative political analysis, with regression modeling as a focal application. We will begin with a brief survey of probability theory, types of measurements, and descriptive statistics. The bulk of the course then addresses inferential statistics, covering in detail sampling, methods for estimating unknown quantities, and methods for evaluating competing hypotheses. We will see how to formally assess estimators, and some basic principles that help to ensure optimality. Along the way, we will introduce the use of regression models to specify social scientific hypotheses, and employ our expanding repertoire of statistical concepts to understand and interpret estimates based on our data. Weekly lab exercises require students to deploy the methods both 'by hand' so they can grasp the basic mathematics, and by computer to meet the conceptual demands of non-trivial examples and prepare for independent research. Some time will be spent reviewing algebra, calculus, and elementary logic, as well as introducing computer statistical packages"

The class will then study revolutionary movements and the social actors that participate within them. The second half of the course will focus on various ""new"" social movements that have altered the region's social and political landscape over the past twenty years, including movements organized around gender issues, human rights, environmental protection, shantytown communities, and indigenous rights. Special attention will be given to the construction and transformation of collective identities, and to new patterns of social protest in response to market globalization in the region"

This course is intended as an overview of the political position of Latinos y Latinas in the United States. We place special emphasis on how Latinos became racial group which allows us to focus on political relationships between Latinos and non-Latinos as they relate to political institutions, political parties, voting coalitions, representation and public policy"

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?"
GOVT 4735,"Marx, Freud, Nietzsche",4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"COML 4250, GERST 4150",(CA-AS),(HB),,"This is an introduction to the three 'master thinkers' who have helped determine the discourses of modernity and post-modernity. We consider basic aspects of their work: (a) specific critical and historical analyses; (b) theoretical and methodological writings; (c) programs and manifestos; and (d) styles of argumentation, documentation, and persuasion. This also entails an introduction, for non-specialists, to essential problems of political economy, continental philosophy, psychology, and literary and cultural criticism. Second, we compare the underlying assumptions and the interpretive yields of the various disciplines and practices founded by Marx, Nietzsche, and Freud: historical materialism and communism, existentialism and power-knowledge analysis, and psychoanalysis, respectively. We also consider how these three writers have been fused into a single constellation, 'Marx-Nietzsche-Freud,' and how they have been interpreted by others, including L. Althusser, A. Badiou, A. Camus, H. Cixous, G. Deleuze, J. Derrida, M. Foucault, H.-G. Gadamer, M. Heidegger, L. Irigaray, K. Karatani, J. Lacan, P. Ricoeur, L. Strauss, S. Zizek"

Considering prison a threshold that resists outsiders' efforts to comprehend inmate experience, we will read from works of prison ethnography, history, film and memoirs that approach different cultures of confinement and consider how the prison has become a problematic zone of state experimentation. Emphasis will be given to works that shed light on the professional and religious vocations that straddle prison worlds and the world beyond the prison walls, helping to generate new ethical relationships as well as political associations for social justice with captive state populations"

It does so based on the premise that what China does in Asia may not necessarily be the sole determinant of the type of security order that will prevail there, but, that it does have a profound influence on the region (and, potentially, on the global order as well). In other words, in order to gain an understanding of the state of security issues in Asia today the seminar attempts to come to terms with the evolving nature of China's foreign policy and national security strategies. The course then concentrates on the most influential academic work on China's foreign relations and national security policies that has been published since the end of the Cold War"

Apart from being a thesis writing workshop, the honors research class serves as a capstone course giving an overview of the different topics and methods addressed by students of politics. Members of the class will do extensive reading in published work relevant to their topics, and write a critical summary of that literature. Each member of the class will present their research design and central question(s) to the class for constructive criticism. By the end of the class, each honors student will have written the first chapter of the thesis, including the statement of the question, literature review, key definitions, methodology, and identification of data source(s).

We will explore the political origins of the American racial order and the ways it has both persisted and changed over time. Focusing on participation, representation and resistance, we will emphasize the political agency of racialized groups while recognizing the power of institutions and policies in shaping their trajectory.

GOVT 6215,Michel Foucault: Sovereignty to BioPolitics,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ASRC 6212, ENGL 6912",,,,"This course will explore the ways in which Michel Foucault's oeuvre transitions from a concern with sovereignty to a preoccupation with biopolitics. Foucault's early work (one understands that there is no absolute Foucaultian division into ""sovereignty"" and ""biopolitics""), such as ""Madness and Civilization,"" attends to the structure, the construction and the force of the institution -- the birth of asylum, the prison, while his later career takes up the question of, for want of a better term, ""political efficiency."" That is, Foucault offers a critique of sovereignty insofar as sovereignty is inefficient (neither the sovereign nor sovereign power can be everywhere; certainly not everywhere it needs or wants to be; ubiquity is impossible, even/especially for a project such as sovereignty) while biopower is not. Biopower marks this recognition; in place of sovereignty biopower ""devolves"" to the individual subject the right, always an intensely political phenomenon, to make decisions about everyday decisions -- decisions about health, sexuality, ""lifestyle."" In tracing the foucaultian trajectory from sovereignty to biopower we will read the major foucaultian texts -- ""Madness and Civilization,"" ""Birth of the Prison,"" ""History of Sexuality"" as well as the various seminars where Foucault works out important issues"

The goal will be to convey a rich appreciation for the possibilities that experimental research offers, as well as a thoughtful understanding of the shortcomings of this research method. In addition, students will gain valuable knowledge in questionnaire design that can be used not only in experiments but in all forms of research that involve surveys (such as focus groups, one-on-one interviews, etc.)"

HIST 1301,FWS: History of the Essay,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"The analytical essay seems to be the basic form of nonfiction writing—but why?  And how did it come to be seen this way?  Why don't you learn to write prose poems in college, or memos, or just elaborate lists?  Or are those also essays?  How has the essay varied across time and cultures?  How has its form been influenced by historical forces, and how did essayists become shapers of their historical moments?  The word ""essay"" just means an attempt, so this course will be experimental and exploratory, analyzing many different essays in their historical context, and pausing occasionally to dwell on key writers like Montaigne, Thoreau, Woolf, Sontag, and Baldwin.  And of course you will be expected to make several attempts at creative essay-writing. "

We move from the initial ""encounters"" of peoples from Africa and Iberia with the ""New World,"" the creation of long-distance trade with, and settlement in, Asia, and the establishment of colonial societies, through to the movements for independence in most of mainland Spanish America in the early 19th century and to the collapse of Spanish rule in the Pacific and Caribbean later that century.

We examine novels, diaries, short essays, and photographic collections by explorers, colonial officials, naturalists, and tourists who travel to and from Southeast Asia. To the extent we can, we also read works about Europe and America written by Southeast Asians. In addition to attending to a writer's subjectivity as it is produced through writing about others, we also consider the historical, political, and economic conditions that make travel possible. We will examine how travel writing is inflected with assumptions about the cultural values, race, class, and gender of both travelers and their domestic audience, on the one hand, and the people and places they write about, on the other. We will write about our own travel experiences and photos even as we critique the travel writing genre.

Attention then shifts to several different senses of the wider family (patrilineal, matrilineal, and marital), to the assemblage of those who shared a common surname, their sumptuous townhouses (""palazzi""), conflicts within families, and the role of families in politics. The study of these topics is made possible by the survival in large numbers of letters, memoirs, medical treatises, literary works, advice books, legal documents, and government legislation and record-keeping concerning family life.

We then examine – in his correspondence, poetry, and especially in The Prince (1513) – the impact on his early political thought of this experience and of the republic's collapse in 1512, an event with traumatic personal consequences for Machiavelli. Although he is best known for the ideas in The Prince, Machiavelli subsequently engaged in a constant process of rethinking and revising those ideas. In the works of his most prolific and creative period from 1515 to 1525 – the Discourses on Livy, the Art of War, the plays Mandragola and Clizia, the Florentine Histories, and more poetry – Machiavelli challenged prevailing notions of history, of antiquity as a model for imitation, of political agency, and of the relative merits and weaknesses of different political systems.

What social and political forces caused the German state(s) to unleash two world wars and several genocides? What role did the military play? Why were opponents unable to stop these developments?

This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B.

This ""Bloodhound Bill"" was designed to make ""slave"" catchers of all Northern whites. Instead it set in motion waves of protests, transformed previously silent whites into underground conductors, further emboldened veteran underground workers and forced thousands of self emancipated Northern blacks to emigrate. The Underground Railroad contributed to convincing Southerners that the Government would not or could not protect slavery. This course examines underground activism beginning in 1850 and offers an interpretation of how the Underground Railroad led to emancipation. The ebbs and flows of underground activity; transnational networks; Civil War military and geo-political issues; and what W.E.B. DuBois called the ""General Strike"" all contributed to making the Thirteenth Amendment a foregone conclusion"

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.

The intervention of government in many of these aspects of family life will also be investigated. Attention then shifts to several different senses of the wider family (patrilineal, matrilineal, and marital), to the assemblage of those who shared a common surname, their sumptuous townhouses (""palazzi""), conflicts within families, and the role of families in politics. The study of these topics is made possible by the survival in large numbers of letters, memoirs, medical treatises, literary works, advice books, legal documents, and government legislation and record-keeping concerning family life.

ITAL 3510,Machiavelli,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"HIST 3510, MEDVL 3510",(HA-AS),(HB),,"This course explores the writings of the most famous and controversial political theorist in the Western tradition. We begin with the political and cultural context of Machiavelli's early life and education, and his work in the government of the Florentine republic from 1498 to 1512 as head of the second chancery, diplomatic envoy, and military reformer. We then examine – in his correspondence, poetry, and especially in The Prince (1513) – the impact on his early political thought of this experience and of the republic's collapse in 1512, an event with traumatic personal consequences for Machiavelli. Although he is best known for the ideas in The Prince, Machiavelli subsequently engaged in a constant process of rethinking and revising those ideas. In the works of his most prolific and creative period from 1515 to 1525 – the Discourses on Livy, the Art of War, the plays Mandragola and Clizia, the Florentine Histories, and more poetry – Machiavelli challenged prevailing notions of history, of antiquity as a model for imitation, of political agency, and of the relative merits and weaknesses of different political systems. His analysis of politics increasingly focused on how relations among social classes conditioned the possibilities for liberty, law, and the various forms of government. These issues will be explored through close analysis and discussion of the primary texts"

JWST 4739,Animating the Talmud: Representing Classic Jewish Texts in Film,4,Graded,Fall,,,"NES 4739, NES 6739",(LA-AS),(GHB),,"The meaning of the Talmud has been a hotly debated topic by both Jews and Christians for more than 1500 years.  This course will use a series of animated short films based on stories found in the Talmud to ask questions about interpretation, performance, authorship, and the role readers play in the production of pre-existing texts.  In what ways is a film director forced to view a text through a different lens than a reader?  What role does an actor play in the production of meaning in a linguistically static script?  In the process of reading a text, we produce visual images in our own minds.  These images are sometimes drawn to reflect textual cues provided by the author, but quite often are the result of subconscious interpretive acts, where we are forced to write in the space that the author left blank.  How can bringing this aspect of the interpretive process to the foreground help us understand what it is we do when we read?  How can learning to read a text through the eyes of an artist change the way we read; and how can reading itself be a productive form of art?  The Talmud presents its laconic narratives in a manner that encourages readers to partner in the act of its writing.  The Talmud's literary form, therefore, makes it an ideal text through which to examine the art of close reading.  (All Texts will be read in translation and no previous knowledge of Talmud is necessary.)"

LAW 7375,Judicial Enforcement of Socio-Economic Rights,3,Graded,Fall,,,,,,,"The purpose of the seminar is to introduce students to the complexities involved in the judicial enforcement of social and economic rights, in particular, the philosophical, democratic and practical concerns about the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights. These concerns arise sharply in the context of the inclusion of social and economic rights in a constitution that is to be interpreted and enforced by the courts. Is the enforcement of these rights by courts undemocratic? Does the inclusion of these rights in a constitution force courts to violate the principle of the separation of powers because in the course of adjudicating on these rights courts are invariably required to make decisions that have implications for the allocation of resources and the formulation of policy? Do courts have the institutional competence to make decisions that are polycentric in nature? To lay foundation for exploring these concerns, the seminar will consider (a) the foundation of social and economic rights; (b) the emergence of the international regime on social and economic rights; and (c) various methods use in national legal systems to protect social and economic rights. The debate on the role of the judiciary in the enforcement of social and economic rights will be explored in the light of judicial experiences in countries such as India, South Africa, United States and Northern Ireland"

The main objective of this aspect of the program is to enhance and reinforce academic learning by providing students the opportunity to actively engage with individuals and organizations directly involved in the administration of law in Africa in a variety of concentrations. The seminar will examine problems of law and how they have been addressed in Africa with particular attention to the interaction of the common law, African customary law, and other imported systems of law. Legal interaction between Africa and Europe, which began before colonial rule, intensified during the colonial period and has continued after independence. During the Colonial period, the Common Law and Civil law were imported into Africa and operated alongside customary law. The result is that pluralism of law is a common feature of legal systems in nearly all African states. The conflicts between the imported laws and customary law have generated considerable interest in reform and the integration of laws in various African countries as well as creating an opportunity to look to other legal system for alternative approaches"

LAW 7756,Statutory and Constitutional Interpretation,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,PHIL 6480,,,,"The purpose of this seminar is to examine in detail the main theories of statutory and constitutional interpretation employed by the US Federal courts, and to shed light on the nature of the debates and disagreements between them. We will examine the three main dominant theories in statutory interpretation: intentionalism, purposivism, and textualism, showing how disagreements between them concern both descriptive matters about the nature of language and interpretation, and normative matters concerning the proper role of the judiciary in a democratic regime. In the context of Constitutional interpretation we will pay close attention to the rationale of constitutionalism, how it bears on constitutional interpretation, and how it explains the various ideological disputes between justices of the supreme court about the grounds and the legitimacy of their constitutional decisions. "
LAW 7779,Theoretical Issues in Discrimination Law,2,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"In this seminar, which lasts only until the midterm break (7 weeks), we will study a range of theoretical puzzles about the law regulating discrimination in employment, service-provision, education, and many other contexts. Our discussions will range across discrimination on grounds of sex, race, religion, sexuality, political viewpoint, and many other grounds. Examples will be taken from US constitutional law and from federal legislation, but also from the law of other jurisdictions. The seminar is about theoretical puzzles that cross the boundaries between different places and times and contexts, rather than about policy design or advocacy. Our puzzles will include: What exactly is wrong with discrimination, when it is wrong? Does the wrongness depend on the consequences? What makes a certain ground of discrimination an improper ground? Is it wrong to discriminate on such grounds in friendships, romantic relationships, etc. as well as in employment, schooling, etc.? Is indirect discrimination ('disparate impact') really a kind of discrimination? Is there any essential connection between discrimination and equality? Why is discrimination a suitable matter for legal regulation, rather than something to be left to private ethics or the market? As these sample questions suggest, we will not shy away from testing our most basic and cherished assumptions. Although there are no prerequisites, some knowledge of the Civil Rights Act 1964 (or similar legislation) would be an advantage. The seminar attracts 2 credits and meets the writing requirement"

LAW 7785,War Crimes Trials and the Law of Genocide,3,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,,,,,"Beginning in November 1945, in an unprecedented attempt to bring war criminals to justice, more than 20 senior government officials and military leaders of Hitlerʼs Third Reich were indicted and tried, in what has become known as the Nuremberg Trial, for crimes against peace, war crimes, and crimes against humanity. Earlier that fall, the SS commandants, officers and guards who had been arrested by the British upon the liberation of the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, had been tried before a British military tribunal. These were the first of numerous trials of Nazi war criminals and related criminal and civil proceedings arising out of the Holocaust. This seminar will examine legal and ethical issues raised in these and other trials of Nazi war criminals and individuals accused of collaborating with the Nazis in perpetrating crimes against humanity, including the 1947 ""Justice Trial"" of Nazi judges and senior officials of the Third Reich Ministry of Justice, the Eichmann Trial in Jerusalem and the 1963-64 Tel Aviv trial of Hersz Barenblat, the head of the Jewish police in the ghetto of Bedzin, Poland.

The intervention of government in many of these aspects of family life will also be investigated. Attention then shifts to several different senses of the wider family (patrilineal, matrilineal, and marital), to the assemblage of those who shared a common surname, their sumptuous townhouses (""palazzi""), conflicts within families, and the role of families in politics. The study of these topics is made possible by the survival in large numbers of letters, memoirs, medical treatises, literary works, advice books, legal documents, and government legislation and record-keeping concerning family life.

We begin with the political and cultural context of Machiavelli's early life and education, and his work in the government of the Florentine republic from 1498 to 1512 as head of the second chancery, diplomatic envoy, and military reformer. We then examine – in his correspondence, poetry, and especially in The Prince (1513) – the impact on his early political thought of this experience and of the republic's collapse in 1512, an event with traumatic personal consequences for Machiavelli. Although he is best known for the ideas in The Prince, Machiavelli subsequently engaged in a constant process of rethinking and revising those ideas. In the works of his most prolific and creative period from 1515 to 1525 – the Discourses on Livy, the Art of War, the plays Mandragola and Clizia, the Florentine Histories, and more poetry – Machiavelli challenged prevailing notions of history, of antiquity as a model for imitation, of political agency, and of the relative merits and weaknesses of different political systems. His analysis of politics increasingly focused on how relations among social classes conditioned the possibilities for liberty, law, and the various forms of government.

How has music in Africa provided a unique position of individual and communal articulation with (post)colonialism, nationalism, crisis, and global representation? How has music worked to empower or disempower certain populations, and what are the implications of its use in the interest of politics? How do frameworks such as cosmopolitanism and Afropolitanism expand or limit our understandings of popular musical cultures in Africa?

Recently a great deal of attention has been paid to political tensions between the Obama administration and the Netanyahu led Israeli government, yet there is a long history of American policy makers, realist and idealist, Republican and Democratic alike, clashing with their Israeli counterparts. So too, American interests in the region, particularly the US close alliance with Saudi Arabia as well as Egypt and Jordan have undergone various transformations over the past two generations.

The readings for the course are chosen from a global African perspective. This does not mean that we will not read any of the 'traditional' texts.

Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms.

We live in a hazardous world of uncertainty, surrounded by claims about risks, some sounding the alarm, some seeking to reassure. Scientists, engineers, and managers try to measure and model the risks embedded in complex systems, hoping to improve our understanding and guide decisions. This seminar will consider risk from the perspective of the social sciences. How do individuals, organizations, and societies produce knowledge about hazards? How do they decide which threats deserve their attention? How do conflicting viewpoints about risk shape technology and politics? We will examine controversies in public health, disaster management, finance, and emerging technologies. Students will gain practice writing short analytic papers, Op/Ed pieces, fictional narratives, and personal reflections"

Moreover, there are many ways to understand how we have, do, and could value the environment from animal rights and wise use to deep ecology and ecofeminism. This class acquaints students with some of the challenging moral issues that arise in the context of environmental management and policy-making, both in the past and the present. Environmental concerns also highlight important economic, epistemological, legal, political, and social issues in assessing our moral obligations to nature as well as other humans. This course examines various perspectives expressed in both contemporary and historical debates over environmental ethics by exploring four central questions: What is nature? Who counts in environmental ethics? How do we know nature? Whose nature?"

STS 2761,Governing Everyday Life,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,SOC 2760,(SBA-AS),,,"Traffic lights, elevators, and recycling bins seem rather boring and irrelevant. Yet, while not usually on our minds when thinking about governance and regulation, these seemingly mundane technologies are important features of our lives. This course will take a closer look at everyday solutions to public problems. Combining hands-on exercises with readings from STS, sociology, and politics, we shall explore the role of everyday devices and technologies in establishing, maintaining, and disrupting social order. How to think about these ""small"" solutions to ""big"" problems? What are the tools and tricks for analyzing things we take for granted? How might these insights challenge longstanding ideas about accountability, technology, and governance? Working through these questions will be particularly useful for students interested in sociology, design, and public policy"

This course examines evolution as a science and places it in an historical context.  Lectures focus on descent with modification, the nature of natural  selection, the history of the earth, the information content of the fossil record, and processes responsible for diversification (speciation and extinction).  The science of evolutionary biology is presented in the context of a broader history of ideas in science.  The course also explores the importance of evolutionary thinking in the 21st century, including discussion of antibiotic and pesticide resistance, personalized genomics, climate change, and the conflict between creationists and evolutionists"

STS 3011,Life Sciences and Society,4,Graded,Fall,,,BSOC 3011,(SBA-AS),,,"Biology and biotechnology are major influences on modern life. In addition, socio-political and historical conditions have shaped biological research and its applications in medicine, agriculture, environmental science, etc. Life science research is itself a social process involving complex human dynamics, different kinds of work and an array of social and natural systems. The course aims to introduce students to critical science and technology studies (S&TS) perspectives on the knowledge and practices of life sciences. The course is designed to prepare students for more advanced courses in the Biology & Society and S&TS majors, but students who do not plan to take further courses in those subjects can get critical insight into biology's profound role in both science and society"

STS 3121,Sound Studies: An Introduction,4,Graded,Fall,,,MUSIC 3432,(CA-AS),,,Sound as a medium has been neglected not only in the sciences but also in social sciences and humanities. We will engage with new emerging work in sound studies by addressing specific locations and activities where sound is important. These include histories of key sonic technologies such as the phonograph and electronic music synthesizer; places where sound is particularly pertinent such as the recording studio and the Laboratory of Ornithology; and practices where sound is the medium such as the use of the stethoscope in medicine. We will also examine interesting sonic locales such as the rain forests of Papua New Guinea. We will cover how sound figures in everyday activities such as economic exchange and in new media such as movies and video games

We will emphasize interactions among leading environmental policy strategies: public regulation, market-based incentives, and community-based resource management. The course is focused around a set of analytic perspectives.  These theoretical frameworks allow us to synthesize empirical observations and material changes in ways that inform our understanding of contemporary evolution of environmental policy and management"
STS 3460,Anthropology of the Body,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"ANTHR 3465, BSOC 3460",(CA-AS),(GB),,"The body is often taken for granted as the material substrate for culture -- its physicality the purview of science and its meaning the purview of social studies. This course examines a range of texts that treat the body as both subject and object of cultural, technological, political, and ethical processes. Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. We will attend to histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, and commodity. Others will contend that the production and reproduction of the body across different times and spaces challenges traditional notions of materiality and physicality"

STS 4122,Darwin and the Making of Histories,4,Graded,Fall,,,"BSOC 4122, HIST 4122",(HA-AS),,,"The power of a name is sometimes as great as that of an idea.  This course will study how Darwin became, then and now, an icon rather than just a Victorian naturalist.  We will look at writings of Darwin himself, especially On the Origin of Species (1859), Descent of Man (1871), and his short autobiography, and attempt to understand what they meant in their own time, how Darwin came to write them, and how his contemporaries helped to shape their future.  How did Victorian ideologies of gender, race, and class shape the production and reception of Darwin's work?  We will also examine the growth of ""Darwinism"" as a set of broader social and cultural movements, particularly in Britain and the United States.  Were eugenics movements examples or perversions of Darwinism?  Finally, we will consider how Darwin's name has been used by more recent evolutionary biologists and by American anti-evolutionists"
STS 4231,Gender and Technology in Historical Perspectives,4,Graded,Fall,,,"FGSS 4231, HIST 4231",(HA-AS),,,"Why are some technologies such as cars and computers associated with men and masculinity? How did vacuums and sewing machines become gendered female? How do technological artifacts and systems constitute, mediate, and reproduce gender identities and gender relations? How do technologies uphold gender hierarchies and thus social inequalities? This class explores the relationship between gender and technology in comparative cultural, social, and historical perspective. Specific themes include meanings, camouflage, and display; socializations; industrialization, labor, and work; technologies of war; the postwar workplace; sex and sexuality; and reproductive technologies. Most course materials focus on Western Europe and the United States since the late 18th century, but the issues raised in this class will prepare students to think about the relationship between gender and technology in other contexts including our own"
STS 4303,The GMO Debate: Science and Society,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,"BSOC 4303, GOVT 4303, IARD 4303, PLSCS 4303",(SBA-AS),,,"Biotechnology is a broad term for the tools used to alter living organisms for human purposes. Genetic engineering (recombinant DNA technology) is one class of methods used in biotechnology. Private sector firms are actively marketing transgenic crops and other products of biotechnology globally. The public sector has been somewhat less active, but is becoming increasingly involved in transgenic technologies, particularly in less-industrialized countries. Developmental questions begin with those we ask of all technology: at whose cost, to whose benefit? Social movements have arisen to block both the testing and commercializing of biotechnology products, arguing that the developmental consequences are negative. Their objections center on the issues of food sovereignty, effects of land use change on the environment, ownership of transgenic traits and the genetic background in which they are placed (intellectual property), environmental uncertainties/risks, control of the food supply by multinational corporations and human health issues. Students will evaluate the legitimacy of various arguments and political positions relative to scientific findings and cultural norms. They will seek to understand the dimensions of political contention: what is at stake? Why does the controversy reach global dimensions? What are the concrete interests involved?"

Focus is on those collections that consist of replicas (e.g. musical instruments, Rau plow collection, plaster cast collection, Blaschka glass models of invertebrates). We will explore the collection's and their object's multiple temporalities, materiality and correspondent multi-disciplinarity. What purpose do/did these copies serve within a given discipline? How are they made to translate a prototype? How did/does this ""translation"" affect the way the very prototype was understood by different disciplines?

In particular, we will focus on the combination of natural science and art history that informs Pliny's text, and the notions of enkyklios paedia (or ""general education"") with which it has been problematically associated. The course will include sessions in the library's Special Collections, focusing on Cornell's prized collection of early printed editions of the Natural History. All works will be taught in translation; students may acquire an additional credit by attending sessions in which we will read Pliny in the original Latin"

After the first semester, students receive a letter grade of ""R""; a letter grade for both semesters is submitted at the end of the second semester whether or not the student completes a thesis or is recommended for honors. Minimally, an honors thesis outline and bibliography should be completed during the first semester. In consultation with the advisors, the director of undergraduate studies will evaluate whether the student should continue working on an honors project. Students should note that these courses are to be taken in addition to those courses that meet the regular major requirements. If students do not complete the second semester of the honors project, they must change the first semester to independent study to clear the ""R"" and receive a grade.

STS 6321,Inside Technology,4,Stdnt Opt,Fall,,,SOC 6320,,,,"Rather than analyze the social impact of technology upon society, this course investigates how society gets inside technology. In other words, is it possible that the very design of technologies embody assumptions about the nature of society? And, if so, are alternative technologies, which embody different assumptions about society, possible? Do engineers have implicit theories about society? Is technology gendered? How can we understand the interaction of society and technology? Throughout the course the arguments are illustrated by detailed examinations of particular technologies, such as the ballistic missile, the bicycle, the electric car, and the refrigerator"

Students investigate the cultivation of physical and social bodies through ethnographic and historical materials concerning healing and medicine, discipline and labor, governance and religion, aesthetics and desire. The production and reproduction of bodies and embodied practices have long been central to the way that power works. In this class, we will read and discuss a range of approach to the body. There is much contention over how work, politics, environment, technologies, and violence shape the body and the senses. We will debate how histories of the body are intertwined with histories of gender, race, class, sexuality, (post)coloniality, modernization, science, transnationalism, and the webs of institution, ideas, and capital that comprise these phenomena. Some readings will investigate the complex mediations that account for the body as icon, text, metaphor, commodity, and raw material. Others will contend that serious attention to the production and reproduction of the body across different times and spaces challenge traditional notions of materiality and physicality. Because every examination of the body rests-implicitly or explicitly-in a theoretical and methodological approach to experience, we will also explore the histories of bodily senses, appetites, and capabilities. Ultimately, our inquiry into contests over and reflections on ""the body,"" as well as specific bodies, aims to open up broader anthropological questions about authority, agency, sovereignties, and material life"
